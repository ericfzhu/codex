"Here's to the crazy ones. The misfits. The rebels. The troublemakers. The round pegs in the square holes. The ones who see things differently. They're not fond of rules. And they have no respect for the status quo. You can quote them, disagree with them, glorify or vilify them. About the only thing you can't do is ignore them. Because they change things.

"Only once in your life, I truly believe, you find someone who can completely turn your world around. You tell them things that you’ve never shared with another soul and they absorb everything you say and actually want to hear more. You share hopes for the future, dreams that will never come true, goals that were never achieved and the many disappointments life has thrown at you. When something wonderful happens, you can’t wait to tell them about it, knowing they will share in your excitement. They are not embarrassed to cry with you when you are hurting or laugh with you when you make a fool of yourself. Never do they hurt your feelings or make you feel like you are not good enough, but rather they build you up and show you the things about yourself that make you special and even beautiful. There is never any pressure, jealousy or competition but only a quiet calmness when they are around. You can be yourself and not worry about what they will think of you because they love you for who you are. The things that seem insignificant to most people such as a note, song or walk become invaluable treasures kept safe in your heart to cherish forever. Memories of your childhood come back and are so clear and vivid it’s like being young again. Colours seem brighter and more brilliant. Laughter seems part of daily life where before it was infrequent or didn’t exist at all. A phone call or two during the day helps to get you through a long day’s work and always brings a smile to your face. In their presence, there’s no need for continuous conversation, but you find you’re quite content in just having them nearby. Things that never interested you before become fascinating because you know they are important to this person who is so special to you. You think of this person on every occasion and in everything you do. Simple things bring them to mind like a pale blue sky, gentle wind or even a storm cloud on the horizon. You open your heart knowing that there’s a chance it may be broken one day and in opening your heart, you experience a love and joy that you never dreamed possible. You find that being vulnerable is the only way to allow your heart to feel true pleasure that’s so real it scares you. You find strength in knowing you have a true friend and possibly a soul mate who will remain loyal to the end. Life seems completely different, exciting and worthwhile. Your only hope and security is in knowing that they are a part of your life.",bob marley,

The Paradoxical Commandments


People are illogical, unreasonable, and self-centered.
Love them anyway.

If you do good, people will accuse you of selfish ulterior motives.
Do good anyway.

If you are successful, you will win false friends and true enemies.
Succeed anyway.

The good you do today will be forgotten tomorrow.
Do good anyway.

Honesty and frankness make you vulnerable.
Be honest and frank anyway.

The biggest men and women with the biggest ideas can be shot down by the smallest men and women with the smallest minds.
Think big anyway.

People favor underdogs but follow only top dogs.
Fight for a few underdogs anyway.

What you spend years building may be destroyed overnight.
Build anyway.

People really need help but may attack you if you do help them.
Help people anyway.

"This life is what you make it. No matter what, you're going to mess up sometimes, it's a universal truth. But the good part is you get to decide how you're going to mess it up. Girls will be your friends - they'll act like it anyway. But just remember, some come, some go. The ones that stay with you through everything - they're your true best friends. Don't let go of them. Also remember, sisters make the best friends in the world. As for lovers, well, they'll come and go too. And baby, I hate to say it, most of them - actually pretty much all of them are going to break your heart, but you can't give up because if you give up, you'll never find your soulmate. You'll never find that half who makes you whole and that goes for everything. Just because you fail once, doesn't mean you're gonna fail at everything. Keep trying, hold on, and always, always, always believe in yourself, because if you don't, then who will, sweetie? So keep your head high, keep your chin up, and most importantly, keep smiling, because life's a beautiful thing and there's so much to smile about.",marilyn monroe,

"You may not be her first, her last, or her only. She loved before she may love again. But if she loves you now, what else matters? She's not perfect—you aren't either, and the two of you may never be perfect together but if she can make you laugh, cause you to think twice, and admit to being human and making mistakes, hold onto her and give her the most you can. She may not be thinking about you every second of the day, but she will give you a part of her that she knows you can break—her heart. So don't hurt her, don't change her, don't analyze and don't expect more than she can give.

A true soul mate is probably the most important person you'll ever meet, because they tear down your walls and smack you awake. But to live with a soul mate forever? Nah. Too painful. Soul mates, they come into your life just to reveal another layer of yourself to you, and then leave. 

A soul mates purpose is to shake you up, tear apart your ego a little bit, show you your obstacles and addictions, break your heart open so new light can get in, make you so desperate and out of control that you have to transform your life, then introduce you to your spiritual master...",elizabeth gilbert,"Eat, Pray, Love"

"You should date a girl who reads.
Date a girl who reads. Date a girl who spends her money on books instead of clothes, who has problems with closet space because she has too many books. Date a girl who has a list of books she wants to read, who has had a library card since she was twelve.

Find a girl who reads. You’ll know that she does because she will always have an unread book in her bag. She’s the one lovingly looking over the shelves in the bookstore, the one who quietly cries out when she has found the book she wants. You see that weird chick sniffing the pages of an old book in a secondhand book shop? That’s the reader. They can never resist smelling the pages, especially when they are yellow and worn.

She’s the girl reading while waiting in that coffee shop down the street. If you take a peek at her mug, the non-dairy creamer is floating on top because she’s kind of engrossed already. Lost in a world of the author’s making. Sit down. She might give you a glare, as most girls who read do not like to be interrupted. Ask her if she likes the book.

Buy her another cup of coffee.

Let her know what you really think of Murakami. See if she got through the first chapter of Fellowship. Understand that if she says she understood James Joyce’s Ulysses she’s just saying that to sound intelligent. Ask her if she loves Alice or she would like to be Alice.

It’s easy to date a girl who reads. Give her books for her birthday, for Christmas, for anniversaries. Give her the gift of words, in poetry and in song. Give her Neruda, Pound, Sexton, Cummings. Let her know that you understand that words are love. Understand that she knows the difference between books and reality but by god, she’s going to try to make her life a little like her favorite book. It will never be your fault if she does.

She has to give it a shot somehow.

Lie to her. If she understands syntax, she will understand your need to lie. Behind words are other things: motivation, value, nuance, dialogue. It will not be the end of the world.

Fail her. Because a girl who reads knows that failure always leads up to the climax. Because girls who read understand that all things must come to end, but that you can always write a sequel. That you can begin again and again and still be the hero. That life is meant to have a villain or two.

Why be frightened of everything that you are not? Girls who read understand that people, like characters, develop. Except in the Twilight series.

If you find a girl who reads, keep her close. When you find her up at 2 AM clutching a book to her chest and weeping, make her a cup of tea and hold her. You may lose her for a couple of hours but she will always come back to you. She’ll talk as if the characters in the book are real, because for a while, they always are.

You will propose on a hot air balloon. Or during a rock concert. Or very casually next time she’s sick. Over Skype.

You will smile so hard you will wonder why your heart hasn’t burst and bled out all over your chest yet. You will write the story of your lives, have kids with strange names and even stranger tastes. She will introduce your children to the Cat in the Hat and Aslan, maybe in the same day. You will walk the winters of your old age together and she will recite Keats under her breath while you shake the snow off your boots.

Date a girl who reads because you deserve it. You deserve a girl who can give you the most colorful life imaginable. If you can only give her monotony, and stale hours and half-baked proposals, then you’re better off alone. If you want the world and the worlds beyond it, date a girl who reads.

Or better yet, date a girl who writes.",rosemarie urquico,

There is nothing enlightened about shrinking so that other people won't feel insecure around you. We are all meant to shine, as children do. We were born to make manifest the glory of God that is within us. It's not just in some of us; it's in everyone.

Two roads diverged in a yellow wood,
And sorry I could not travel both	
And be one traveler, long I stood	
And looked down one as far as I could	
To where it bent in the undergrowth;	 
 
Then took the other, as just as fair,	
And having perhaps the better claim,	
Because it was grassy and wanted wear;	
Though as for that the passing there	
Had worn them really about the same,	 
 
And both that morning equally lay	
In leaves no step had trodden black.	
Oh, I kept the first for another day!	
Yet knowing how way leads on to way,	
I doubted if I should ever come back.

Somewhere ages and ages hence:	
Two roads diverged in a wood, and I—	
I took the one less traveled by,

"I can believe things that are true and things that aren't true and I can believe things where nobody knows if they're true or not. 

I can believe in Santa Claus and the Easter Bunny and the Beatles and Marilyn Monroe and Elvis and Mister Ed. Listen - I believe that people are perfectable, that knowledge is infinite, that the world is run by secret banking cartels and is visited by aliens on a regular basis, nice ones that look like wrinkled lemurs and bad ones who mutilate cattle and want our water and our women. 

I believe that the future sucks and I believe that the future rocks and I believe that one day White Buffalo Woman is going to come back and kick everyone's ass. I believe that all men are just overgrown boys with deep problems communicating and that the decline in good sex in America is coincident with the decline in drive-in movie theaters from state to state. 

I believe that all politicians are unprincipled crooks and I still believe that they are better than the alternative. I believe that California is going to sink into the sea when the big one comes, while Florida is going to dissolve into madness and alligators and toxic waste. 

I believe that antibacterial soap is destroying our resistance to dirt and disease so that one day we'll all be wiped out by the common cold like martians in War of the Worlds. 

I believe that the greatest poets of the last century were Edith Sitwell and Don Marquis, that jade is dried dragon sperm, and that thousands of years ago in a former life I was a one-armed Siberian shaman. 

I believe that mankind's destiny lies in the stars. I believe that candy really did taste better when I was a kid, that it's aerodynamically impossible for a bumble bee to fly, that light is a wave and a particle, that there's a cat in a box somewhere who's alive and dead at the same time (although if they don't ever open the box to feed it it'll eventually just be two different kinds of dead), and that there are stars in the universe billions of years older than the universe itself. 

I believe in a personal god who cares about me and worries and oversees everything I do. I believe in an impersonal god who set the universe in motion and went off to hang with her girlfriends and doesn't even know that I'm alive. I believe in an empty and godless universe of causal chaos, background noise, and sheer blind luck. 

I believe that anyone who says sex is overrated just hasn't done it properly. I believe that anyone who claims to know what's going on will lie about the little things too. 

I believe in absolute honesty and sensible social lies. I believe in a woman's right to choose, a baby's right to live, that while all human life is sacred there's nothing wrong with the death penalty if you can trust the legal system implicitly, and that no one but a moron would ever trust the legal system. 

I believe that life is a game, that life is a cruel joke, and that life is what happens when you're alive and that you might as well lie back and enjoy it.",neil gaiman,American Gods

In other words, loneliness is something I've never been bothered with because I've always had this terrible itch for solitude. It's being at a party, or at a stadium full of people cheering for something, that I might feel loneliness. I'll quote Ibsen, ""The strongest men are the most alone."" I've never thought, ""Well, some beautiful blonde will come in here and give me a fuck-job, rub my balls, and I'll feel good."" No, that won't help. You know the typical crowd, ""Wow, it's Friday night, what are you going to do? Just sit there?"" Well, yeah. Because there's nothing out there. It's stupidity. Stupid people mingling with stupid people. Let them stupidify themselves. I've never been bothered with the need to rush out into the night. I hid in bars, because I didn't want to hide in factories.

"Once on a yellow piece of paper with green lines
	he wrote a poem
And he called it ""Chops""
	because that was the name of his dog

And that's what it was all about
And his teacher gave him an A
	and a gold star
And his mother hung it on the kitchen door
	and read it to his aunts
That was the year Father Tracy
	took all the kids to the zoo

And he let them sing on the bus
And his little sister was born
	with tiny toenails and no hair
And his mother and father kissed a lot
And the girl around the corner sent him a
Valentine signed with a row of X's

	and he had to ask his father what the X's meant
And his father always tucked him in bed at night
And was always there to do it

Once on a piece of white paper with blue lines
	he wrote a poem
And he called it ""Autumn""

	because that was the name of the season
And that's what it was all about
And his teacher gave him an A
	and asked him to write more clearly
And his mother never hung it on the kitchen door
	because of its new paint

And the kids told him
	that Father Tracy smoked cigars
And left butts on the pews
And sometimes they would burn holes
That was the year his sister got glasses
	with thick lenses and black frames
And the girl around the corner laughed

	when he asked her to go see Santa Claus
And the kids told him why
	his mother and father kissed a lot
And his father never tucked him in bed at night
And his father got mad
	when he cried for him to do it.


Once on a paper torn from his notebook
	he wrote a poem
And he called it ""Innocence: A Question""
	because that was the question about his girl
And that's what it was all about
And his professor gave him an A

	and a strange steady look
And his mother never hung it on the kitchen door
	because he never showed her
That was the year that Father Tracy died
And he forgot how the end
	of the Apostle's Creed went

And he caught his sister
	making out on the back porch
And his mother and father never kissed
	or even talked
And the girl around the corner
	wore too much makeup
That made him cough when he kissed her

	but he kissed her anyway
	because that was the thing to do
And at three a.m. he tucked himself into bed
	his father snoring soundly

That's why on the back of a brown paper bag
	he tried another poem

And he called it ""Absolutely Nothing""
Because that's what it was really all about
And he gave himself an A
	and a slash on each damned wrist
And he hung it on the bathroom door
	because this time he didn't think

	he could reach the kitchen.",stephen chbosky,The Perks of Being a Wallflower

"The so-called ‘psychotically depressed’ person who tries to kill herself doesn’t do so out of quote ‘hopelessness’ or any abstract conviction that life’s assets and debits do not square. And surely not because death seems suddenly appealing. The person in whom Its invisible agony reaches a certain unendurable level will kill herself the same way a trapped person will eventually jump from the window of a burning high-rise. Make no mistake about people who leap from burning windows. Their terror of falling from a great height is still just as great as it would be for you or me standing speculatively at the same window just checking out the view; i.e. the fear of falling remains a constant. The variable here is the other terror, the fire’s flames: when the flames get close enough, falling to death becomes the slightly less terrible of two terrors. It’s not desiring the fall; it’s terror of the flames. And yet nobody down on the sidewalk, looking up and yelling ‘Don’t!’ and ‘Hang on!’, can understand the jump. Not really. You’d have to have personally been trapped and felt flames to really understand a terror way beyond falling.",david foster wallace,

"We’re all seeking that special person who is right for us. But if you’ve been through enough relationships, you begin to suspect there’s no right person, just different flavors of wrong. Why is this? Because you yourself are wrong in some way, and you seek out partners who are wrong in some complementary way. But it takes a lot of living to grow fully into your own wrongness. And it isn’t until you finally run up against your deepest demons, your unsolvable problems—the ones that make you truly who you are—that we’re ready to find a lifelong mate. Only then do you finally know what you’re looking for. You’re looking for the wrong person.

"Men always say that as the defining compliment, don’t they? She’s a cool girl. Being the Cool Girl means I am a hot, brilliant, funny woman who adores football, poker, dirty jokes, and burping, who plays video games, drinks cheap beer, loves threesomes and anal sex, and jams hot dogs and hamburgers into her mouth like she’s hosting the world’s biggest culinary gang bang while somehow maintaining a size 2, because Cool Girls are above all hot. Hot and understanding. Cool Girls never get angry; they only smile in a chagrined, loving manner and let their men do whatever they want. Go ahead, shit on me, I don’t mind, I’m the Cool Girl.

Men actually think this girl exists. Maybe they’re fooled because so many women are willing to pretend to be this girl. For a long time Cool Girl offended me. I used to see men – friends, coworkers, strangers – giddy over these awful pretender women, and I’d want to sit these men down and calmly say: You are not dating a woman, you are dating a woman who has watched too many movies written by socially awkward men who’d like to believe that this kind of woman exists and might kiss them. I’d want to grab the poor guy by his lapels or messenger bag and say: The bitch doesn’t really love chili dogs that much – no one loves chili dogs that much! And the Cool Girls are even more pathetic: They’re not even pretending to be the woman they want to be, they’re pretending to be the woman a man wants them to be. Oh, and if you’re not a Cool Girl, I beg you not to believe that your man doesn’t want the Cool Girl. It may be a slightly different version – maybe he’s a vegetarian, so Cool Girl loves seitan and is great with dogs; or maybe he’s a hipster artist, so Cool Girl is a tattooed, bespectacled nerd who loves comics. There are variations to the window dressing, but believe me, he wants Cool Girl, who is basically the girl who likes every fucking thing he likes and doesn’t ever complain. (How do you know you’re not Cool Girl? Because he says things like: “I like strong women.” If he says that to you, he will at some point fuck someone else. Because “I like strong women” is code for “I hate strong women.”)",gillian flynn,Gone Girl

"Sometimes fate is like a small sandstorm that keeps changing directions. You change direction but the sandstorm chases you. You turn again, but the storm adjusts. Over and over you play this out, like some ominous dance with death just before dawn. Why? Because this storm isn't something that blew in from far away, something that has nothing to do with you. This storm is you. Something inside of you. So all you can do is give in to it, step right inside the storm, closing your eyes and plugging up your ears so the sand doesn't get in, and walk through it, step by step. There's no sun there, no moon, no direction, no sense of time. Just fine white sand swirling up into the sky like pulverized bones. That's the kind of sandstorm you need to imagine.

And you really will have to make it through that violent, metaphysical, symbolic storm. No matter how metaphysical or symbolic it might be, make no mistake about it: it will cut through flesh like a thousand razor blades. People will bleed there, and you will bleed too. Hot, red blood. You'll catch that blood in your hands, your own blood and the blood of others.

And once the storm is over you won't remember how you made it through, how you managed to survive. You won't even be sure, in fact, whether the storm is really over. But one thing is certain. When you come out of the storm you won't be the same person who walked in. That's what this storm's all about.",haruki murakami,Kafka on the Shore

"Dare to Be

When a new day begins, dare to smile gratefully.

When there is darkness, dare to be the first to shine a light.

When there is injustice, dare to be the first to condemn it.

When something seems difficult, dare to do it anyway.

When life seems to beat you down, dare to fight back.

When there seems to be no hope, dare to find some.

When you’re feeling tired, dare to keep going.

When times are tough, dare to be tougher.

When love hurts you, dare to love again.

When someone is hurting, dare to help them heal.

When another is lost, dare to help them find the way.

When a friend falls, dare to be the first to extend a hand.

When you cross paths with another, dare to make them smile.

"For me, trees have always been the most penetrating preachers. I revere them when they live in tribes and families, in forests and groves. And even more I revere them when they stand alone. They are like lonely persons. Not like hermits who have stolen away out of some weakness, but like great, solitary men, like Beethoven and Nietzsche. In their highest boughs the world rustles, their roots rest in infinity; but they do not lose themselves there, they struggle with all the force of their lives for one thing only: to fulfil themselves according to their own laws, to build up their own form, to represent themselves. Nothing is holier, nothing is more exemplary than a beautiful, strong tree. When a tree is cut down and reveals its naked death-wound to the sun, one can read its whole history in the luminous, inscribed disk of its trunk: in the rings of its years, its scars, all the struggle, all the suffering, all the sickness, all the happiness and prosperity stand truly written, the narrow years and the luxurious years, the attacks withstood, the storms endured. And every young farmboy knows that the hardest and noblest wood has the narrowest rings, that high on the mountains and in continuing danger the most indestructible, the strongest, the ideal trees grow.

 Trees are sanctuaries. Whoever knows how to speak to them, whoever knows how to listen to them, can learn the truth. They do not preach learning and precepts, they preach, undeterred by particulars, the ancient law of life.

 A tree says: A kernel is hidden in me, a spark, a thought, I am life from eternal life. The attempt and the risk that the eternal mother took with me is unique, unique the form and veins of my skin, unique the smallest play of leaves in my branches and the smallest scar on my bark. I was made to form and reveal the eternal in my smallest special detail.

 A tree says: My strength is trust. I know nothing about my fathers, I know nothing about the thousand children that every year spring out of me. I live out the secret of my seed to the very end, and I care for nothing else. I trust that God is in me. I trust that my labor is holy. Out of this trust I live.

 When we are stricken and cannot bear our lives any longer, then a tree has something to say to us: Be still! Be still! Look at me! Life is not easy, life is not difficult. Those are childish thoughts. Let God speak within you, and your thoughts will grow silent. You are anxious because your path leads away from mother and home. But every step and every day lead you back again to the mother. Home is neither here nor there. Home is within you, or home is nowhere at all.

 A longing to wander tears my heart when I hear trees rustling in the wind at evening. If one listens to them silently for a long time, this longing reveals its kernel, its meaning. It is not so much a matter of escaping from one's suffering, though it may seem to be so. It is a longing for home, for a memory of the mother, for new metaphors for life. It leads home. Every path leads homeward, every step is birth, every step is death, every grave is mother.

 So the tree rustles in the evening, when we stand uneasy before our own childish thoughts: Trees have long thoughts, long-breathing and restful, just as they have longer lives than ours. They are wiser than we are, as long as we do not listen to them. But when we have learned how to listen to trees, then the brevity and the quickness and the childlike hastiness of our thoughts achieve an incomparable joy. Whoever has learned how to listen to trees no longer wants to be a tree. He wants to be nothing except what he is. That is home. That is happiness.",herman hesse,Bäume: Betrachtungen und Gedichte

"Look again at that dot. That's here. That's home. That's us. On it everyone you love, everyone you know, everyone you ever heard of, every human being who ever was, lived out their lives. The aggregate of our joy and suffering, thousands of confident religions, ideologies, and economic doctrines, every hunter and forager, every hero and coward, every creator and destroyer of civilization, every king and peasant, every young couple in love, every mother and father, hopeful child, inventor and explorer, every teacher of morals, every corrupt politician, every ""superstar,"" every ""supreme leader,"" every saint and sinner in the history of our species lived there-on a mote of dust suspended in a sunbeam.

The Earth is a very small stage in a vast cosmic arena. Think of the endless cruelties visited by the inhabitants of one corner of this pixel on the scarcely distinguishable inhabitants of some other corner, how frequent their misunderstandings, how eager they are to kill one another, how fervent their hatreds. Think of the rivers of blood spilled by all those generals and emperors so that, in glory and triumph, they could become the momentary masters of a fraction of a dot.

Our posturings, our imagined self-importance, the delusion that we have some privileged position in the Universe, are challenged by this point of pale light. Our planet is a lonely speck in the great enveloping cosmic dark. In our obscurity, in all this vastness, there is no hint that help will come from elsewhere to save us from ourselves.

The Earth is the only world known so far to harbor life. There is nowhere else, at least in the near future, to which our species could migrate. Visit, yes. Settle, not yet. Like it or not, for the moment the Earth is where we make our stand.

It has been said that astronomy is a humbling and character-building experience. There is perhaps no better demonstration of the folly of human conceits than this distant image of our tiny world. To me, it underscores our responsibility to deal more kindly with one another, and to preserve and cherish the pale blue dot, the only home we've ever known.",carl sagan,Pale Blue Dot: A Vision of the Human Future in Space

"The paradox of our time in history is that we have taller buildings but shorter tempers, wider Freeways, but narrower viewpoints. We spend more, but have less, we buy more, but enjoy less. We have bigger houses and smaller families, more conveniences, but less time. We have more degrees but less sense, more knowledge, but less judgment, more experts, yet more problems, more medicine, but less wellness.

We drink too much, smoke too much, spend too recklessly, laugh too little, drive too fast, get too angry, stay up too late, get up too tired, read too little, watch TV too much, and pray too seldom. We have multiplied our possessions, but reduced our values. We talk too much, love too seldom, and hate too often.

We've learned how to make a living, but not a life. We've added years to life not life to years. We've been all the way to the moon and back, but have trouble crossing the street to meet a new neighbor. We conquered outer space but not inner space. We've done larger things, but not better things.

We've cleaned up the air, but polluted the soul. We've conquered the atom, but not our prejudice. We write more, but learn less. We plan more, but accomplish less. We've learned to rush, but not to wait. We build more computers to hold more information, to produce more copies than ever, but we communicate less and less.

These are the times of fast foods and slow digestion, big men and small character, steep profits and shallow relationships.

These are the days of two incomes but more divorce, fancier houses, but broken homes. These are days of quick trips, disposable diapers, throwaway morality, one night stands, overweight bodies, and pills that do everything from cheer, to quiet, to kill. It is a time when there is much in the showroom window and nothing in the stockroom. A time when technology can bring this letter to you, and a time when you can choose either to share this insight, or to just hit delete...

Remember, to spend some time with your loved ones, because they are not going to be around forever. Remember, say a kind word to someone who looks up to you in awe, because that little person soon will grow up and leave your side.

Remember, to give a warm hug to the one next to you, because that is the only treasure you can give with your heart and it doesn't cost a cent.

Remember, to say, ""I love you"" to your partner and your loved ones, but most of all mean it. A kiss and an embrace will mend hurt when it comes from deep inside of you.

Remember to hold hands and cherish the moment for someday that person might not be there again. Give time to love, give time to speak! And give time to share the precious thoughts in your mind.",bob moorehead,Words Aptly Spoken

Despite everything, I can't bear the thought of this ring being lost forever, any more then I can bear the thought of leaving you forever. And though I have no choice about the one, at least I can choose about the other. I'm leaving you our family ring because you have as much right to it as I do.
I'm writing this watching the sun come up. You're asleep, dreams moving behind your restless eyelids. I wish I knew what you were thinking. I wish I could slip into your head and see the world the way you do. I wish I could see myself the way you do. But maybe I dont want to see that. Maybe it would make me feel even more than I already do that I'm perpetuating some kind of Great Lie on you, and I couldn't stand that. 
I belong to you. You could do anything you wanted with me and I would let you. You could ask anything of me and I'd break myself trying to make you happy. My heart tells me this is the best and greatest feeling I have ever had. But my mind knows the difference between wanting what you can't have and wanting what you shouldn't want. And I shouldn't want you.
All night I've watched you sleeping, watched the moonlight come and go, casting its shadows across your face in black and white. I've never seen anything more beautiful. I think of the life we could have had if things were different, a life where this night is not a singular event, separate from everything else that's real, but every night. But things aren't different, and I can't look at you without feeling like I've tricked you into loving me.
The truth no one is willing to say out loud is that no one has a shot against Valentine but me. I can get close to him like no one else can. I can pretend I want to join him and he'll believe me, up until that last moment where I end it all, one way or another. I have something of Sebastian's; I can track him to where my father's hiding, and that's what I'm going to do. So I lied to you last night. I said I just wanted one night with you. But I want every night with you. And that's why I have to slip out of your window now, like a coward. Because if I had to tell you this to your face, I couldn't make myself go. 
I don't blame you if you hate me, I wish you would. As long as I can still dream, I will dream of you.

Love is not breathlessness, it is not excitement, it is not the promulgation of promises of eternal passion, it is not the desire to mate every second minute of the day, it is not lying awake at night imagining that he is kissing every cranny of your body.

"To be, or not to be: that is the question:
Whether 'tis nobler in the mind to suffer
The slings and arrows of outrageous fortune,
Or to take arms against a sea of troubles,
And by opposing end them? To die: to sleep;
No more; and by a sleep to say we end
The heart-ache and the thousand natural shocks
That flesh is heir to, 'tis a consummation
Devoutly to be wish'd. To die, to sleep;
To sleep: perchance to dream: ay, there's the rub;
For in that sleep of death what dreams may come
When we have shuffled off this mortal coil,
Must give us pause: there's the respect
That makes calamity of so long life;
For who would bear the whips and scorns of time,
The oppressor's wrong, the proud man's contumely,
The pangs of despised love, the law's delay,
The insolence of office and the spurns
That patient merit of the unworthy takes,
When he himself might his quietus make
With a bare bodkin? who would fardels bear,
To grunt and sweat under a weary life,
But that the dread of something after death,
The undiscover'd country from whose bourn
No traveller returns, puzzles the will
And makes us rather bear those ills we have
Than fly to others that we know not of?
Thus conscience does make cowards of us all;
And thus the native hue of resolution
Is sicklied o'er with the pale cast of thought,
And enterprises of great pith and moment
With this regard their currents turn awry,
And lose the name of action.--Soft you now!

"Perhaps the greatest faculty our minds possess is the ability to cope with pain. Classic thinking teaches us of the four doors of the mind, which everyone moves through according to their need.

First is the door of sleep. Sleep offers us a retreat from the world and all its pain. Sleep marks passing time, giving us distance from the things that have hurt us. When a person is wounded they will often fall unconscious. Similarly, someone who hears traumatic news will often swoon or faint. This is the mind's way of protecting itself from pain by stepping through the first door.

Second is the door of forgetting. Some wounds are too deep to heal, or too deep to heal quickly. In addition, many memories are simply painful, and there is no healing to be done. The saying 'time heals all wounds' is false. Time heals most wounds. The rest are hidden behind this door.

Third is the door of madness. There are times when the mind is dealt such a blow it hides itself in insanity. While this may not seem beneficial, it is. There are times when reality is nothing but pain, and to escape that pain the mind must leave reality behind. 

Last is the door of death. The final resort. Nothing can hurt us after we are dead, or so we have been told.",patrick rothfuss,The Name of the Wind

Was there ever a more beautiful sound than your name? To speak it aloud makes my heart ring like a bell. Strange to imagine that, isn’t it – a heart ringing – but when you touch me that is what it is like: as if my heart is ringing in my chest and the sound shivers down my veins and splinters my bones with joy.

Why have I written these words in this book? Because of you. You taught me to love this book where I had scorned it. When I read it for the second time, with an open mind and heart, I felt the most complete despair and envy of Sydney Carton. Yes, Sydney, for even if he had no hope that the woman he loved would love him, at least he could tell her of his love. At least he could do something to prove his passion, even if that thing was to die.

I would have chosen death for a chance to tell you the truth, Tessa, if I could have been assured that death would be my own. And that is why I envied Sydney, for he was free.

And now at last I am free, and I can finally tell you, without fear of danger to you, all that I feel in my heart.

You are not the last dream of my soul.

You are the first dream, the only dream I ever was unable to stop myself from dreaming. You are the first dream of my soul, and from that dream I hope will come all other dreams, a lifetime’s worth.

"The best fantasy is written in the language of dreams. It is alive as dreams are alive, more real than real ... for a moment at least ... that long magic moment before we wake.

 Fantasy is silver and scarlet, indigo and azure, obsidian veined with gold and lapis lazuli. Reality is plywood and plastic, done up in mud brown and olive drab. Fantasy tastes of habaneros and honey, cinnamon and cloves, rare red meat and wines as sweet as summer. Reality is beans and tofu, and ashes at the end. Reality is the strip malls of Burbank, the smokestacks of Cleveland, a parking garage in Newark. Fantasy is the towers of Minas Tirith, the ancient stones of Gormenghast, the halls of Camelot. Fantasy flies on the wings of Icarus, reality on Southwest Airlines. Why do our dreams become so much smaller when they finally come true?

 We read fantasy to find the colors again, I think. To taste strong spices and hear the songs the sirens sang. There is something old and true in fantasy that speaks to something deep within us, to the child who dreamt that one day he would hunt the forests of the night, and feast beneath the hollow hills, and find a love to last forever somewhere south of Oz and north of Shangri-La.

risen from the earth, lives darkly in my body.

I love you without knowing how, or when, or from where.
I love you straightforwardly, without complexities or pride;

"Once upon a midnight dreary, while I pondered, weak and weary,
Over many a quaint and curious volume of forgotten lore,
While I nodded, nearly napping, suddenly there came a tapping,
As of some one gently rapping, rapping at my chamber door.
Tis some visitor,"" I muttered, ""tapping at my chamber door —
 Only this, and nothing more.""

Ah, distinctly I remember it was in the bleak December,
And each separate dying ember wrought its ghost upon the floor.
Eagerly I wished the morrow; — vainly I had sought to borrow
From my books surcease of sorrow — sorrow for the lost Lenore —
For the rare and radiant maiden whom the angels name Lenore —
 Nameless here for evermore.

And the silken sad uncertain rustling of each purple curtain
Thrilled me — filled me with fantastic terrors never felt before;
So that now, to still the beating of my heart, I stood repeating,
Tis some visitor entreating entrance at my chamber door —
Some late visitor entreating entrance at my chamber door; —
 This it is, and nothing more.""

Presently my soul grew stronger; hesitating then no longer,
Sir,"" said I, ""or Madam, truly your forgiveness I implore;
But the fact is I was napping, and so gently you came rapping,
And so faintly you came tapping, tapping at my chamber door,
That I scarce was sure I heard you""— here I opened wide the door; —
 Darkness there, and nothing more.

Deep into that darkness peering, long I stood there wondering, fearing,
Doubting, dreaming dreams no mortals ever dared to dream before;
But the silence was unbroken, and the stillness gave no token,
And the only word there spoken was the whispered word, ""Lenore?""
This I whispered, and an echo murmured back the word, ""Lenore!"" —
 Merely this, and nothing more.

Back into the chamber turning, all my soul within me burning,
Soon again I heard a tapping somewhat louder than before.
Surely,"" said I, ""surely that is something at my window lattice:
Let me see, then, what thereat is, and this mystery explore —
Let my heart be still a moment and this mystery explore; —
 'Tis the wind and nothing more.""

Open here I flung the shutter, when, with many a flirt and flutter,
In there stepped a stately raven of the saintly days of yore;
Not the least obeisance made he; not a minute stopped or stayed he;
But, with mien of lord or lady, perched above my chamber door —
Perched upon a bust of Pallas just above my chamber door —
 Perched, and sat, and nothing more.

Then this ebony bird beguiling my sad fancy into smiling,
By the grave and stern decorum of the countenance it wore.
Though thy crest be shorn and shaven, thou,"" I said, ""art sure no craven,
Ghastly grim and ancient raven wandering from the Nightly shore —
Tell me what thy lordly name is on the Night's Plutonian shore!""
 Quoth the Raven, ""Nevermore.""

Much I marveled this ungainly fowl to hear discourse so plainly,
Though its answer little meaning— little relevancy bore;
For we cannot help agreeing that no living human being
Ever yet was blest with seeing bird above his chamber door —
Bird or beast upon the sculptured bust above his chamber door,
 With such name as ""Nevermore.",edgar allan poe,The Raven

""How very rude of him.""
""I told him I was.""
Dumbledore opened his mouth to speak and then closed it again. Fawkes the phoenix let out a low, soft, musical cry. To Harry's intense embarrassment, he suddenly realized that Dumbledore's bright blue eyes looked rather watery, and stared hastily at his own knee. When Dumbledore spoke, however, his voice was quite steady.

Speak with integrity. Say only what you mean. Avoid using the word to speak against yourself or to gossip about others. Use the power of your word in the direction of truth and love. 

2. Don't Take Anything Personally
Nothing others do is because of you. What others say and do is a projection of their own reality, their own dream. When you are immune to the opinions and actions of others, you won't be the victim of needless suffering. 

3. Don't Make Assumptions
Find the courage to ask questions and to express what you really want. Communicate with others as clearly as you can to avoid misunderstandings, sadness and drama. With just this one agreement, you can completely transform your life. 

4. Always Do Your Best
Your best is going to change from moment to moment; it will be different when you are healthy as opposed to sick. Under any circumstance, simply do your best, and you will avoid self-judgment, self-abuse and regret.",don miguel ruiz,

If you expect to find people who will understand you, you will grow murderous with disappointment. The best you'll ever do is to understand yourself, know what it is that you want, and not let the cattle stand in your way.",janet fitch,White Oleander

"When God Created Mothers""
 
When the Good Lord was creating mothers, He was into His sixth day of ""overtime"" when the angel appeared and said. ""You're doing a lot of fiddling around on this one."" 

And God said, ""Have you read the specs on this order?"" She has to be completely washable, but not plastic. Have 180 moveable parts...all replaceable. Run on black coffee and leftovers. Have a lap that disappears when she stands up. A kiss that can cure anything from a broken leg to a disappointed love affair. And six pairs of hands."" 

The angel shook her head slowly and said. ""Six pairs of hands.... no way."" 

It's not the hands that are causing me problems,"" God remarked, ""it's the three pairs of eyes that mothers have to have."" 

That's on the standard model?"" asked the angel. God nodded. 

One pair that sees through closed doors when she asks, 'What are you kids doing in there?' when she already knows. Another here in the back of her head that sees what she shouldn't but what she has to know, and of course the ones here in front that can look at a child when he goofs up and say. 'I understand and I love you' without so much as uttering a word."" 

God,"" said the angel touching his sleeve gently, ""Get some rest tomorrow...."" 

I can't,"" said God, ""I'm so close to creating something so close to myself. Already I have one who heals herself when she is sick...can feed a family of six on one pound of hamburger...and can get a nine year old to stand under a shower."" 

The angel circled the model of a mother very slowly. ""It's too soft,"" she sighed. 

But tough!"" said God excitedly. ""You can imagine what this mother can do or endure."" 

Can it think?"" 

Not only can it think, but it can reason and compromise,"" said the Creator. 

Finally, the angel bent over and ran her finger across the cheek. 

There's a leak,"" she pronounced. ""I told You that You were trying to put too much into this model."" 

It's not a leak,"" said the Lord, ""It's a tear."" 

What's it for?"" 

It's for joy, sadness, disappointment, pain, loneliness, and pride."" 

You are a genius, "" said the angel.

"make a radical change in your lifestyle and begin to boldly do things which you may previously never have thought of doing, or been too hesitant to attempt. So many people live within unhappy circumstances and yet will not take the initiative to change their situation because they are conditioned to a life of security, conformity, and conservation, all of which may appear to give one peace of mind, but in reality nothing is more damaging to the adventurous spirit within a man than a secure future. The very basic core of a man's living spirit is his passion for adventure. The joy of life comes from our encounters with new experiences, and hence there is no greater joy than to have an endlessly changing horizon, for each day to have a new and different sun. If you want to get more out of life, you must lose your inclination for monotonous security and adopt a helter-skelter style of life that will at first appear to you to be crazy. But once you become accustomed to such a life you will see its full meaning and its incredible beauty.",jon krakauer,Into the Wild

"I sit beside the fire and think 
Of all that I have seen
Of meadow flowers and butterflies
In summers that have been

Of yellow leaves and gossamer
In autumns that there were
With morning mist and silver sun
And wind upon my hair

I sit beside the fire and think
Of how the world will be
When winter comes without a spring 
That I shall ever see

For still there are so many things
That I have never seen
In every wood in every spring
There is a different green

I sit beside the fire and think
Of people long ago
And people that will see a world
That I shall never know

But all the while I sit and think
Of times there were before
I listen for returning feet 
And voices at the door",j.r.r. tolkien,

I will love you as we find ourselves farther and farther from one another, where we once we were so close that we could slip the curved straw, and the long, slender spoon, between our lips and fingers respectively.
I will love you until the chances of us running into one another slip from slim to zero, and until your face is fogged by distant memory, and your memory faced by distant fog, and your fog memorized by a distant face, and your distance distanced by the memorized memory of a foggy fog. I will love you no matter where you go and who you see, no matter where you avoid and who you don’t see, and no matter who sees you avoiding where you go.

 1. The moment you realize that the person you cared for has nothing intellectually or spiritually to offer you, but a headache.

3. The moment you stop comparing yourself to others because it undermines your worth, education and your parent’s wisdom.

4. The moment you live your dreams, not because of what it will prove or get you, but because that is all you want to do. People’s opinions don’t matter. 

5. The moment you realize that no one is your enemy, except yourself.

6. The moment you realize that you can have everything you want in life. However, it takes timing, the right heart, the right actions, the right passion and a willingness to risk it all. If it is not yours, it is because you really didn’t want it, need it or God prevented it. 

7. The moment you realize the ghost of your ancestors stood between you and the person you loved. They really don't want you mucking up the family line with someone that acts anything less than honorable.

8. The moment you realize that happiness was never about getting a person. They are only a helpmate towards achieving your life mission.

"Don't aim at success. The more you aim at it and make it a target, the more you are going to miss it. For success, like happiness, cannot be pursued; it must ensue, and it only does so as the unintended side effect of one's personal dedication to a cause greater than oneself or as the by-product of one's surrender to a person other than oneself. Happiness must happen, and the same holds for success: you have to let it happen by not caring about it. I want you to listen to what your conscience commands you to do and go on to carry it out to the best of your knowledge. Then you will live to see that in the long-run—in the long-run, I say!—success will follow you precisely because you had forgotten to think about it",viktor e. frankl,Man’s Search for Meaning

"You think because he doesn't love you that you are worthless. You think that because he doesn't want you anymore that he is right -- that his judgement and opinion of you are correct. If he throws you out, then you are garbage. You think he belongs to you because you want to belong to him. Don't. It's a bad word, 'belong.' Especially when you put it with somebody you love. Love shouldn't be like that. Did you ever see the way the clouds love a mountain? They circle all around it; sometimes you can't even see the mountain for the clouds. But you know what? You go up top and what do you see? His head. The clouds never cover the head. His head pokes through, beacuse the clouds let him; they don't wrap him up. They let him keep his head up high, free, with nothing to hide him or bind him. You can't own a human being. You can't lose what you don't own. Suppose you did own him. Could you really love somebody who was absolutely nobody without you? You really want somebody like that? Somebody who falls apart when you walk out the door? You don't, do you? And neither does he. You're turning over your whole life to him. Your whole life, girl. And if it means so little to you that you can just give it away, hand it to him, then why should it mean any more to him? He can't value you more than you value yourself.",toni morrison,
"You’ll get over it…” It’s the clichés that cause the trouble. To lose someone you love is to alter your life for ever. You don’t get over it because ‘it” is the person you loved. The pain stops, there are new people, but the gap never closes. How could it? The particularness of someone who mattered enough to grieve over is not made anodyne by death.

"When you go into the ER, one of the first things they ask you to do is rate your pain on a scale of one to ten, and from there they decide which drugs to use and how quickly to use them. I'd been asked this question hundreds of times over the years, and I remember once early on when I couldn't get my breath and it felt like my chest was on fire, flames licking the inside of my ribs fighting for a way to burn out of my body, my parents took me to the ER. nurse asked me about the pain, and I couldn't even speak, so I held up nine fingers.

Later, after they'd given me something, the nurse came in and she was kind of stroking my head while she took my blood pressure and said, ""You know how I know you're a fighter? You called a ten a nine.""

But that wasn't quite right. I called it a nine because I was saving my ten. And here it was, the great and terrible ten, slamming me again and again as I lay still and alone in my bed staring at the ceiling, the waves tossing me against the rocks then pulling me back out to sea so they could launch me again into the jagged face of the cliff, leaving me floating faceup on the water, undrowned.",john green,The Fault in Our Stars

"Stop fighting me!"" he said, trying to pull on the arm he held.

He was in a precarious position himself, straddling the rail as he tried to lean over far enough to get me and actually hold onto me.

“Let go of me!” I yelled back.

But he was too strong and managed to haul most of me over the rail, enough so that I wasn’t in total danger of falling again.

See, here’s the thing. In that moment before I let go, I really had been contemplating my death. I’d come to terms with it and accepted it. I also, however, had known Dimitri might do something exactly like this. He was just that fast and that good. That was why I was holding my stake in the hand that was dangling free.

I looked him in the eye. ""I will always love you.""

Then I plunged the stake into his chest.

It wasn’t as precise a blow as I would have liked, not with the skilled way he was dodging. I struggled to get the stake in deep enough to his heart, unsure if I could do it from this angle. Then, his struggles stopped. His eyes stared at me, stunned, and his lips parted, almost into a smile, albeit a grisly and pained one.

No one wants their life thrown into chaos. That is why a lot of people keep that threat under control, and are somehow capable of sustaining a house or a structure that is already rotten. They are the engineers of the superseded. 

Other people think exactly the opposite: they surrender themselves without a second thought, hoping to find in passion the solutions to all their problems. They make the other person responsible for their happiness and blame them for their possible unhappiness. They are either euphoric because something marvelous has happened or depressed because something unexpected has just ruined everything.

"If I should have a daughter…“Instead of “Mom”, she’s gonna call me “Point B.” Because that way, she knows that no matter what happens, at least she can always find her way to me. And I’m going to paint the solar system on the back of her hands so that she has to learn the entire universe before she can say “Oh, I know that like the back of my hand.”

She’s gonna learn that this life will hit you, hard, in the face, wait for you to get back up so it can kick you in the stomach. But getting the wind knocked out of you is the only way to remind your lungs how much they like the taste of air. There is hurt, here, that cannot be fixed by band-aids or poetry, so the first time she realizes that Wonder-woman isn’t coming, I’ll make sure she knows she doesn’t have to wear the cape all by herself. Because no matter how wide you stretch your fingers, your hands will always be too small to catch all the pain you want to heal. Believe me, I’ve tried.

And “Baby,” I’ll tell her “don’t keep your nose up in the air like that, I know that trick, you’re just smelling for smoke so you can follow the trail back to a burning house so you can find the boy who lost everything in the fire to see if you can save him. Or else, find the boy who lit the fire in the first place to see if you can change him.”

But I know that she will anyway, so instead I’ll always keep an extra supply of chocolate and rain boats nearby, ‘cause there is no heartbreak that chocolate can’t fix. Okay, there’s a few heartbreaks chocolate can’t fix. But that’s what the rain boots are for, because rain will wash away everything if you let it.

I want her to see the world through the underside of a glass bottom boat, to look through a magnifying glass at the galaxies that exist on the pin point of a human mind. Because that’s how my mom taught me. That there’ll be days like this, “There’ll be days like this my momma said” when you open your hands to catch and wind up with only blisters and bruises. When you step out of the phone booth and try to fly and the very people you wanna save are the ones standing on your cape. When your boots will fill with rain and you’ll be up to your knees in disappointment and those are the very days you have all the more reason to say “thank you,” ‘cause there is nothing more beautiful than the way the ocean refuses to stop kissing the shoreline no matter how many times it’s sent away.

You will put the “wind” in win some lose some, you will put the “star” in starting over and over, and no matter how many land mines erupt in a minute be sure your mind lands on the beauty of this funny place called life.

And yes, on a scale from one to over-trusting I am pretty damn naive but I want her to know that this world is made out of sugar. It can crumble so easily but don’t be afraid to stick your tongue out and taste it.

“Baby,” I’ll tell her “remember your mama is a worrier but your papa is a warrior and you are the girl with small hands and big eyes who never stops asking for more.”

Remember that good things come in threes and so do bad things and always apologize when you’ve done something wrong but don’t you ever apologize for the way your eyes refuse to stop shining.

Your voice is small but don’t ever stop singing and when they finally hand you heartbreak, slip hatred and war under your doorstep and hand you hand-outs on street corners of cynicism and defeat, you tell them that they really ought to meet your mother.",sarah kay,

Maybe I'm wrong. ""Two."" Maybe they don't care if we both die. ""Three!"" It's too late to change my mind. I lift my hand to my mouth taking one last look at the world. The berries have just passed my lips when the trumpets begin to blare. The frantic voice of Claudius Templesmith shouts above them. ""Stop! Stop!

"When civilians get into these circumstances, they become ashamed of such a way of life.

A wise man loves not because he wants to profit from it but because he finds bliss in love itself.,leo tolstoy,
"They asked a Chinese man, “What is science?” He said, “Science is knowing people.” Then they asked, “And what is virtue?” He answered, “Virtue is loving people.”",leo tolstoy,
"Just as a mother puts her life at risk to guard and save her only child, so every person should guard and save in himself love for every living being.",leo tolstoy,
"The fearlessness, calm, inner peace, and joy which are given to us by love are so big that all other things in the world cannot be compared with them, especially for the person who understands the real blessing of love.",leo tolstoy,
"For a person to know the law that makes him free, he must be elevated from a material to a spiritual life.",leo tolstoy,
"“I and God are the same,” said the teacher. If you think that my spiritual being is God, you are mistaken. But my real self is close to God, and to other people. In order to understand this part of myself, you should elevate the man inside of you. When you elevate the man inside of you, then you will see that there is no difference between him and any other person on earth.",leo tolstoy,
"It only seems as if we differ from each other. A flower on a blossoming tree can think that it is a separate being, but all flowers are parts of the same blossoming of one apple tree, and they all come from one seed.",leo tolstoy,
Submission to the law created by men makes one a slave; obedience to the law created by God makes one free.,leo tolstoy,
"Wisdom is knowing the purpose of life, and knowing how to achieve it.",leo tolstoy,
There is nothing in which real wisdom cannot be displayed.,leo tolstoy,
"When people wanted to kill a bear in the ancient times, they hung a heavy log over a bowl of honey. The bear would push the log away in order to eat the honey. The log would swing back and hit the bear. The bear would become irritated and push the log even harder, and it would return and hit him harder in return. This would continue until the log killed the bear. People behave in the same way when they return evil for the evil they receive from other people. Can’t people be wiser than bears?",leo tolstoy,
"You should respond with kindness toward evil done to you, and you will destroy in an evil person that pleasure which he derives from evil.",leo tolstoy,
The true teaching of love is strong; it kills evil before evil can grow and become powerful.,leo tolstoy,
"Only greatly insolent people establish a religious law which is to be taken for granted by others, which should be accepted by everyone on faith, without any discussion or doubts.",leo tolstoy,
Why must people do this?,leo tolstoy,
"The essence of the teaching of Christ is to follow his commandments. Those who just repeat, “My God, My Lord” will not get to heaven; only those who fulfill God’s will.",leo tolstoy,
It is not possible to explain the origin of the spiritual from the material.,leo tolstoy,
"The difference between the spiritual realm and the material is equally clear and obvious, both for a child and a wise man; further speculations are not necessary.",leo tolstoy,
"There are two different states of human existence: first, to live without thinking of death; second, to live with the thought that you approach death with every hour of your life.",leo tolstoy,
"The more you transform your life from the material to the spiritual domain, the less you become afraid of death. A person who lives a truly spiritual life has no fear of death.",leo tolstoy,
"When you have doubts about what to do, just imagine that you might die at the end of that same day, and then all your doubts will disappear, and you will see clearly what your conscience tells you, and what is your true personal wish.",leo tolstoy,
"A man condemned to immediate execution will not think about the growth of his estate, or about achieving glory, or about the victory of one group over another, or about the discovery of a new planet. But one minute before his death a man may wish to console an abused person, or help an old person to stand up, or to put a bandage on someone’s injury, or to repair a toy for a child.",leo tolstoy,
Kindness is for your soul as health is for your body: you do not notice it when you have it.,leo tolstoy,
"Love is real only when a person can sacrifice himself for another person. Only when a person forgets himself for the sake of another, and lives for another creature, only this kind of love can be called true love, and only in this love do we see the blessing and reward of life. This is the foundation of the world.",leo tolstoy,
"Nothing can make our life, or the lives of other people, more beautiful than perpetual kindness.",leo tolstoy,
"A man is free only when he lives in truth, and the truth may be perceived only by the intellect.",leo tolstoy,
"We are not free in this world, subdued by our passions and by the emotions of other people to the degree that we forget the requirements of our intellects. If we really want to become free, we can be so only through our intellect.",leo tolstoy,
"All events, whether in the lives of human individuals, or human societies, have their beginnings in thought. Therefore, to fully understand other people and other societies, we must look beyond previous events to the thoughts which gave rise to them.",leo tolstoy,
Perhaps it is even more important to know what one should not think about than what one should think about.,leo tolstoy,
"A thought seems to be free and independent, but a human being has something stronger than thought, something which could guide our thoughts.",leo tolstoy,
"In order to change the nature of things, either within yourself or in others, one should change, not the events, but those thoughts which created those events.",leo tolstoy,
"Sexual desire is the most all-consuming of desires. This desire is never sated, for the more it is satisfied, the more it grows.",leo tolstoy,
"Very often people are made proud by their control over their own desires, and by the force and passion with which they master them. What a strange delusion!",leo tolstoy,
"Many people worry, and suffer, because they have been involved in so many bad things in their lives. In truth, though, good things often happen in spite of our wishes, and sometimes even in opposition to our wishes, and often after our excitement and suffering over unworthy things.",leo tolstoy,
Remember how passionately you yearned in the past for many of the things which you hate or despise now.,leo tolstoy,
"Remember how many things you lost trying to satisfy your former desires. The same thing could happen now, with the desires which excite you at present. Try to tame your present desires, calm them; this is most beneficial, and most achievable.",leo tolstoy,
"Perfecting the self is both an inner and an outer work: You cannot improve yourself without communicating with other people, influencing them, and being influenced by them.",leo tolstoy,
"“Be perfect, as your heavenly Father,” Christ said. This does not mean that Christ asked people to be as good as God; only that everyone should strive for perfection.",leo tolstoy,
"There is nothing more harmful to you than improving only your material, animal side of life. There is nothing more beneficial, both for you and for others, than activity directed to the improvement of your soul.",leo tolstoy,
Why do people like to blame others so much? He who casts blame on another person is quick to think that he would not do the very same thing. It is the same with people who like to listen to the fault-finding of their neighbors.,leo tolstoy,
"When two people have a dispute, both are to blame. And therefore, a dispute will stop only when at least one person understands that he or she is guilty.",leo tolstoy,
"Stop blaming other people, and you will feel what an alcoholic feels when he stops drinking, or what a smoker feels when he stops smoking. You will feel that you have brought relief to your soul.",leo tolstoy,
"The material evil caused by war is big, but it is incomparably small in comparison with the perversion or the understanding of good and bad which happens during the war, and which is put into the souls of people who do not think.",leo tolstoy,
"A child meets another child with a smile, displaying his friendly attitude and joy. This same behavior lives in all sincere people. But very often, a man from one nation already hates a man from another nation, and is ready to cause him sufferings and even death, even before he meets him. Those who create these feelings in nations commit a terrible crime!",leo tolstoy,
War creates a state in which power and glory is at the end too often received by the most undeserving and vicious people.,leo tolstoy,
"The higher the opinion a person has of himself, the more unstable is his position; the lower he moves in his selfesteem, the firmer he stands.",leo tolstoy,
"Try to find out your potential. After you know it, do not be afraid to underestimate it. Be cautious not to exaggerate it.",leo tolstoy,
A person’s life is good only to the extent that it fulfills the expectations of the will of God.,leo tolstoy,
"Evil, in the form of suffering and death, is everywhere apparent to a person who accepts the law of his material, animal existence as the major law of his life. Only when a man lowers himself to the state of an animal does death and suffering scare him. The only road open for him to escape that fear is the road of fulfillment of the law of God, the law which is expressed in love. There is no death and no suffering for a man who lives according to the law of God.",leo tolstoy,
"We know the law of God, both as it is presented to us by the different religions of the world and as our own conscience, when it is not obscured by passion and prejudice, and we can easily understand the applications of this law to our life, for all real good stems from its requirements.",leo tolstoy,
It is obvious for everyone that death expects us all in the long run; but nevertheless we live our lives as if there will be no death.,leo tolstoy,
"The more deeply you understand life, the less you grieve over the destruction caused by death.",leo tolstoy,
Religion is a philosophy which can be understood by anyone.,leo tolstoy,
Religion is simple wisdom which is directed to the heart and understood by the intellect.,leo tolstoy,
"Religion can enlighten philosophical meditations; philosophical meditations can strengthen religion. Therefore, try to communicate both with truly religious people and truly good philosophers, alive and dead.",leo tolstoy,
A holy spirit lives within you.,leo tolstoy,
"God lives in every one of us. When a person remembers this, the thought of it can save him from evil, and help him to do good.",leo tolstoy,
"There is simplicity of nature, and there is simplicity of wisdom. Both of them evoke love and respect.",leo tolstoy,
The greatest truth is the most simple one.,leo tolstoy,
"When people speak in a very elaborate and sophisticated way, they either want to tell a lie, or to admire themselves. You should not believe such people. Good speech is always clear, clever, and understood by all.",leo tolstoy,
"Words can unite people. Therefore, try to speak very clearly, and tell only the truth, for nothing can unite people more than truth and simplicity.",leo tolstoy,
"The younger and the more primitive a person is, the more he or she believes that life is material and that it exists only in the body. The older and wiser a person becomes, the more he or she understands that all life originates from the spirit.",leo tolstoy,
"A person can understand his real destination in life only after he manages to liberate himself from the sensual, material world.",leo tolstoy,
All people of the world have an equal right to the privileges of this world.,leo tolstoy,
"Equality cannot be reached, as some people think, only by civil measures. It can be reached only by love of God and people, and this love can be reached, not by civil measures, but only as the result of spiritual learning.",leo tolstoy,
"They say that equality is not possible, because some people will always be stronger or smarter than others. But it is exactly because of this, said Lichtenberg, precisely because some people are stronger and smarter than others, that the principle of equality is necessary. The advantages of the rich over the poor demonstrate not only inequality of force and intellect, but inequality of civil rights.",leo tolstoy,
"Christ revealed to humanity those things which their best selves already knew: that people are equal because the same spirit lives in all of them…. Learn from the small children, behave like children, and treat all people on an equal basis, with love and tenderness.",leo tolstoy,
"Personality is a mask which disguises the divine being which lives in every person. The more one rejects personality, the more this divine beginning is manifested.",leo tolstoy,
"Only when we forget about ourselves, when we get out of the thoughts of ourselves, can we fruitfully communicate with others, listen to them, and influence them.",leo tolstoy,
"It is a sin not to be engaged in work, even if it is not necessary for you to make your living with everyday work.",leo tolstoy,
"Nothing can make a person feel more noble than work. Without work, a person cannot have human dignity. It is because of this that idle people are so much concerned by the superficial, outer expression of their importance; they know that without this, other people would despise them.",leo tolstoy,
"When we accept truth and repent our sins, we understand that nobody can have special rights, advantages, or privileges in this life. There is no end or limit to our duties and obligations. And the first and the most important obligation for us is to fight with nature for our life and for the lives of other people.",leo tolstoy,
"Humankind goes on without stopping. This movement forward is necessary for you as an individual as well. If you want to serve God, you should be a worker for the spiritual progress of humanity.",leo tolstoy,
"The way of life of any people depends on their faith. Faith, with time, becomes more simple, more clear, and closer to the real truth, and in accordance with the simplifying and clarifying of faith, people become more and more united.",leo tolstoy,
"Mankind makes progress when its faith progresses. And if there is any progress in religion, it is not in the discovery of something new, but in the purifying of the truths which have been revealed and explained to us.",leo tolstoy,
"We should not substitute real religious progress with other types of progress: technical, scholarly, and artistic. These technical, scholarly, and artistic achievements can certainly coexist with religious backwardness, as happens in our time.",leo tolstoy,
"If you want to serve God, you should work on the side of religious progress in the fight against prejudice, toward a better understanding of the clear and pure religion.",leo tolstoy,
"There was a time when people ate each other. They no longer do so, but they still eat animals. The time will come when more and more people will drop this terrible habit.",leo tolstoy,
"The killing and eating of animals is a prejudice accepted by those who think that animals were given to people by God to eat, so that there is nothing wrong in killing them. This is not true. It may be written in some books that it is not a sin to kill an animal, but it is written in our own hearts more clearly than in any books—that we should take pity on animals in the same way as we do on each other. And we all know this, if we do not deaden the voice of our conscience inside of us.",leo tolstoy,
The existing design of life corresponds neither to the requirements of conscience nor to the requirements of intellect.,leo tolstoy,
People are rational creatures. Why do they seem capable of using violence so much more easily than reason in their interactions with each other?,leo tolstoy,
"For a truth to be heard, it must be spoken with kindness. Truth is kind only when it is spoken through your heart with sincerity. You should know that when a message you convey to another person is not understood by him, at least one of the following things is true: what you have said is not true, or you have conveyed it without kindness.",leo tolstoy,
"To tell the truth is the same as to be a good tailor, or to be a good farmer, or to write beautifully. To be good at any activity requires practice: no matter how hard you try, you cannot do naturally what you have not done repeatedly. In order to get accustomed to speaking the truth, you should tell only the truth, even in the smallest of things.",leo tolstoy,
"Truth cannot make a person unkind, or too self-assured; the manifestations of truth telling are humility and simplicity.",leo tolstoy,
"To pray is to accept and to remember the laws of the limitless being, God, and to measure all your deeds—past, present, and future—according to His laws.",leo tolstoy,
"From the ancient times, it has been known that prayer is a human necessity.",leo tolstoy,
"People use different rituals during prayer, special addresses in special circumstances, in special places, in the ways they present their message to God and ask Him to be kind.",leo tolstoy,
"But let there be this constant: during a prayer, forget about all external worldly things and address the divine part of your soul. Use this divine part to gain communication with that of which it is a part and when you feel yourself close to God, you deliver your soul to Him, and show Him all your deeds and wishes. Prayer does not happen according to the requirements of the world, but according to the divine part of your soul.",leo tolstoy,
"After a long conversation, stop and try to remember what you have just discussed. Don’t be surprised if many things, sometimes even everything you have discussed, were meaningless, empty, and trivial, and sometimes even bad.",leo tolstoy,
"For every time you regret that you did not say something, you will regret a hundred times that you did not keep your silence.",leo tolstoy,
"If you want to be a clever person, you have to learn how to ask cleverly, how to listen attentively, how to respond quietly, and how to stop talking when there is nothing more to say.",leo tolstoy,
"If you have time to think before you start talking, think, Is it necessary to speak? Will what I have to say harm anyone?",leo tolstoy,
A charity is only then a real charity when it involves sacrifice.,leo tolstoy,
"In money—in the money itself, in its acquisition, in its possession—there is something immoral.",leo tolstoy,
Art is one of the means of unifying people.,leo tolstoy,
"It is possible to imagine that art could die, but it is not possible to imagine that real art could live if it became a slave of wealth that laughed at the poor.",leo tolstoy,
"Art is one of the most powerful means of convincing people of anything, both good and bad; therefore, you must be very careful in its use.",leo tolstoy,
"Meditations or discussions about art are the most useless pastimes known. Those who really know art know that art can speak well with its own language, and that to speak about art with words is useless. Most people who speak about art do not understand or feel real art.",leo tolstoy,
"To move, you must know where to go, in terms both of everyday motion and of your whole life. In order to live a good life, you must know where life leads.",leo tolstoy,
We should believe that the goodness which exists in us and in this world will be fulfilled. This is the major condition to make it happen.,leo tolstoy,
The fear of death in man is the understanding of his sins.,leo tolstoy,
"The more spiritual a life a person leads, the less he is afraid of death. For a spiritual person death means setting the spirit free from the body. Such a person knows that the things with which he lives cannot be destroyed.",leo tolstoy,
Only those who do not live are not afraid of death.,leo tolstoy,
"If as Socrates said, death is the state in which we abide during our sleep made permanent, we all know this state, and know there is nothing terrible in it. And if death is a transfer to a better life, as many people think, then death is not evil but a blessing.",leo tolstoy,
"We should get ready for death, because it will come, sooner or later. The best thing to do is to live a good life. If you live a good life, you should not be afraid of death.",leo tolstoy,
"The more closely a person unites with the will of God, the firmer this person becomes in his actions.",leo tolstoy,
"The right path in life is very narrow, but it is important to find it. You can understand it, as well as we can understand it, as a walkway of wood built across a swamp; if you step off it, you will plunge into the swamp of misunderstanding and evil. A wise man returns to the true path at once, but a weak man plunges further and further into the swamp, and it becomes more and more difficult for him to get out.",leo tolstoy,
What reward should a good deed bring you? Only the joy you receive by performing it. And any other reward lessens the feeling of this joy.,leo tolstoy,
What a joy it is to do a good deed! And this joy is strongest if no one knows that you have done it.,leo tolstoy,
"Eating to excess is a vice just as bad as many others. We often do not notice it in others, because most of us are subject to it.",leo tolstoy,
"There are sins against others, and sins against yourself. You commit sins against others when you do not respect God’s spirit in them; you commit sins against yourself when you do not respect God’s spirit in yourself. One of the most common sins against yourself is gluttony.",leo tolstoy,
"A person who overeats cannot fight laziness; and a lazy man cannot fight sexual dissipation. All spiritual teachings start with restrictions, with control of the appetite.",leo tolstoy,
"God gave food to people, and the devil gave cooks.",leo tolstoy,
"Socrates, a wise man, tried to abstain from all unnecessary things. He said that food should serve you in fighting your hunger, and not in developing sophisticated tastes, and he asked his students to follow his rule. He reminded his students about the wise Odysseus, whom Circe, an evil sorceress, could not subject to her magic, because he did not eat to excess. But the members of his crew, his friends, were turned into a herd of pigs by her as soon as they rushed to the abundance of sweet food.",leo tolstoy,
"Look at your mouth; through it, when you eat to excess, illnesses enter your body. Behave in such a way that when you finish your dinner, you want to eat a little more.",leo tolstoy,
"Eating to excess is not considered to be a sin by many, because it produces no noticeable harm. But there are sins which destroy human dignity, and eating to excess is one such sin.",leo tolstoy,
"Just as it’s folly to try to lift yourself into the air, you should not praise yourself too much. When you praise yourself, you produce the opposite effect in others, and appear lower in their eyes.",leo tolstoy,
He who always listens to what other people say about him will never find inner peace.,leo tolstoy,
"If you want to preserve your good name, do not praise yourself and do not so much as allow others to praise you.",leo tolstoy,
"Love of God is love in itself; it is love for the sake of love. This kind of love is the highest blessing. It does not allow the slightest possibility of treating even a single creature without love; if there is even one person whom you do not love, then you lose God’s love and blessing.",leo tolstoy,
"Love of your neighbor without love of God is a plant without roots. You should love God—this love is a real and firm love. It does not become weaker, only stronger, and it gives good to those who have it.",leo tolstoy,
"Some say that you should be afraid of God. Not true; you have to love God. How can you love those whom you are afraid of? God is love, and how can you be afraid of love? No, you should not fear God, but love Him. And if you love God, then you will not be afraid of Him, or anything else in the world.",leo tolstoy,
"Physical work, physical exercise for your body, is a necessary condition of life. A man can force others to do things for him, but he cannot free himself from the necessity of his own physical work. And if a man does not work at necessary and good things, then he will work at unnecessary and stupid things.",leo tolstoy,
"A European praised the advantages of mechanized labor to a Chinese man: “This invention relieves a man from the need for physical work.” But the Chinese man replied, “Physical work is good. Being relieved from physical work will be an enormous disaster.”",leo tolstoy,
"Without exercise of their muscles, neither man nor animal can live.",leo tolstoy,
"So that this exercise may give you joy and satisfaction, do good physical work. This is also the best way to serve others.",leo tolstoy,
"Prayer is a time to remind yourself of your attitude to limitless things, to God.",leo tolstoy,
"It is good to pray at the same time each day. If you cannot collect your thoughts, better not to pray, because you should always pray with your heart, not simply repeat words with your tongue.",leo tolstoy,
"It is good and necessary to pray in solitude, but is also good to pray when you are in the crowd, when you are excited or irritated—to think about your soul and about God.",leo tolstoy,
Do not think that you can please God with prayer. You will please God by submitting to Him. Prayer is just a reminder for you of who you are and what the purpose of your life is.,leo tolstoy,
War and Christianity are not compatible.,leo tolstoy,
"War is one of the worst, most terrible things in this world.",leo tolstoy,
"War in this world can be stopped not by the ruling establishment, but by those who suffer from the war. They will do the most natural thing: stop obeying orders.",leo tolstoy,
"The armed world and the wars it wages will be destroyed one day, but not by the kings or the rulers of this world. War is profitable for them. War will stop the moment the people who suffer from war fully understand that it is evil.",leo tolstoy,
That which gives life is the same in all things.,leo tolstoy,
"All living creatures have the same divine beginning, all are in unity. We are all members of one great body.",leo tolstoy,
Expunge from yourself anything which interferes with your feeling of a special connection between yourself and all living creatures.,leo tolstoy,
"Food is necessary for the life of an individual, and marriage is necessary for the life of humanity. If eating to excess is evil for an individual, then excess in marriage and sexuality creates evil both for individuals and for human society.",leo tolstoy,
"A marriage is a special obligation between two people, of opposite sexes, to have children only with each other. To break this pact is a lie, a deception, and a crime.",leo tolstoy,
"The unification of a man and a woman for the continuation of humankind is a great and important deed for every individual, as well as for all mankind. You cannot do it as it pleases you, or as you like it. You have to do it in the way which was thought and set out by the wise and holy people who have lived before us.",leo tolstoy,
"The deeds of a person become his life, become his fate. This is the law of our life.",leo tolstoy,
"The Persians have such a fable: After death, a soul flew into the sky, and met a terrible woman, a dirty and horrible apparition, with festered sores discharging pus, who was going in the opposite direction. “What are you doing here?” asked the soul. “Who are you?” The terrible woman answered, “I am your deeds.”",leo tolstoy,
"Your past deeds weigh heavily on the future direction of your life; but sometimes, you can change this direction through the effort of your spirit.",leo tolstoy,
The condition of wisdom is purity; the consequence of wisdom is the peace of your soul.,leo tolstoy,
A man who follows his wishes changes his attitude with time. Very soon he is not satisfied any more with the things he does.,leo tolstoy,
A wise person never considers himself to be wise. And a person never considers himself wise when he has the image of God before him.,leo tolstoy,
"Wisdom is limitless, and the closer you approach it, the more important it becomes for your life.",leo tolstoy,
A person can always improve himself.,leo tolstoy,
"Love brings people to unification. The universal intellect, which is the same for everyone, supports this unification.",leo tolstoy,
Everything in this world is the manifestation of the divine intellect.,leo tolstoy,

"Be filled with love for other people, including those who are unpleasant or hostile to you. A real trial to one’s love is to love your enemies.",leo tolstoy,
"If you love your enemies, you will have no enemies.",leo tolstoy,
"Every time you are abused by someone and feel animosity toward him, remember that all people are children of God. Regardless of whether this person is unpleasant to you, you should not stop loving him as your brother, because, as much as you are, he is God’s son.",leo tolstoy,
"Modern science cannot studyeverything; without being supported by religion, science does not know what it should study.","jean jacques rousseaua person who knows little likes to talk, and one who knows much mostly keeps silent.this is because a person who knows little thinks that everything he knows is important, and wants to tell everyone. a person who knows much also knows that there is much more he doesn’t know. that’s why he speaks only when it is necessary to speak, and when he is not asked questions, he keeps his silence.",
"Real wisdom is not the knowledge of everything, but the knowledge of which things in life are necessary, which are less necessary, and which are completely unnecessary to know. Among the most necessary knowledge is the knowledge of how to live well, that is, how to produce the least possible evil and the greatest goodness in one’s life.

"Blaming other people is always wrong, because no one knows what has happened and happens in the soul of another person.",leo tolstoy,
"We often make judgments about other people. We call one person kind, the other stupid, the third evil, the fourth clever. But we should not do so. A man changes constantly; he flows like a river, and every new day he differs from what he was before. He was stupid and became clever; he was evil and became kind at heart; and so on. You cannot judge another person. The moment you blame him, he becomes someone different.",leo tolstoy,
"If you want to correct your failings, you do not have the time to waste in blaming other people.",leo tolstoy,
"I know of myself that I do not wish to do evil. If I do evil, it is because I cannot restrain myself. It is the same with other people: they usually do evil because they cannot restrain themselves from evil. Therefore, why do I think badly of other people? Why should I blame them?",leo tolstoy,
"The creation of the world would have been a very bad act were it right for rich people to live off the work of the poor, and yet think that they were the benefactors.",leo tolstoy,
The pleasures of the rich are often acquired by the tears of the poor.,leo tolstoy,
"Wealth is created by the concentration of human labor; usually one people produce labor, and others concentrate it. This is called “the division of labor” by contemporary wise people.",leo tolstoy,
"There is something wrong with the creation of this world, because the rich people think that they are the benefactors of the poor, but in fact those rich are fed and dressed by the work of these poor and live in luxury created for them by the poor.",leo tolstoy,

"Real life is found only in the present. If people tell you that you should live your life preparing for the future, do not believe them.

"Seek the truth: it always shows us what we should do, what we should not do, and what we should stop doing.",leo tolstoy,
"The earth, the air, and the sun belong to all of us; they cannot be made objects of property.",leo tolstoy,
Those who own land in amounts larger than that which is needed to feed their own families can be treated as being guilty of causing the poverty of many other people.,leo tolstoy,
"Only the person who fulfills God’s law can understand God. The more closely he fulfills God’s law, the better he understands God.",leo tolstoy,
"There is not a single believer who from time to time has not had some hesitations about the existence of God. But these moments of hesitation are not harmful. On the contrary, they lead us to a better understanding of God.",leo tolstoy,
Seeking God with your soul is a process that has limitless sides and aspects.,leo tolstoy,
"Jews consider it a sin to state the name of God aloud. They are right: God is spirit, and every name is material and not spiritual.",leo tolstoy,
"During our lives we help each other: sometimes we help other people, sometimes we are helped by others. But the world is formed so that usually some people mostly help others, and some mostly receive their help.",leo tolstoy,
"As you acquire objects, and you use them, you should keep in mind that they are the products of people’s work. When you damage or destroy these objects, you damage or destroy the toil, and this part of the life, of other people.",leo tolstoy,
"Help should be mutual. Moreover, those who accept help and assistance from their brothers should pay them back, not only with money, but with love, respect, and gratitude.",leo tolstoy,
The most important change that can occur in a person’s life is a change in his faith.,leo tolstoy,
"Individuals die, but the wisdom they have obtained in their lives does not die with them. Mankind keeps all this wisdom, and a person uses the wisdom of those who lived before him. The education of mankind reminds me of the creation of the ancient pyramids, in that everyone who lives puts another stone in the foundation.",leo tolstoy,
"It is a big mistake to think that faith is immutable, that it does not change over generations. The longer mankind exists y its faith becomes simpler and stronger. And the simpler and stronger our faith becomes, the better we live.",leo tolstoy,
"If you believe that faith is the same for all times and that it cannot be changed, you might just as well believe that those fairy tales and proverbs and children’s stories which your grandmother told you when you were a small baby are real, and that you ought to believe in them all your life.",leo tolstoy,
"The more a person believes in God, the less he is afraid of other people.",leo tolstoy,
Those who fear people do not fear God; those who fear God do not fear people.,leo tolstoy,
"He who is not afraid of anything, and who is ready to give his life for a righteous cause, is much stronger than he whom other people fear and who has the lives of other people in his power.",leo tolstoy,
Look for the better men among those who are despised.,leo tolstoy,
"Do what you think is necessary, and do not expect reward. Remember that a stupid person is a bad judge of clever deeds.",leo tolstoy,
"You want to save yourself from the power of other people—give yourself to the power of God. If you see yourself as being in the power of God, then people cannot do anything to you.",leo tolstoy,
"Wisdom can be achieved by inner work, through solitary communication with yourself; it also can be achieved when you communicate with other people.",leo tolstoy,
"Real love is not in words but in deeds, and only love can give you real wisdom.",leo tolstoy,
"When you are in company, do not forget what you have found out when you were thinking in solitude; and when you are meditating in solitude, think about what you found out by communicating with other people.",leo tolstoy,
"If sometimes you feel that in spite of all your wishes to gain triumph over your passions, they gain victory over you, do not think that you cannot conquer them at all. You have only proven that you weren’t able to this one time. A good groom does not drop his reins when he cannot stop his horses at once but tries again to pull the reins, and eventually the horses stop. So if you could not resist the temptations once, continue your fight, and in the end not your passion but you will gain the victory.",leo tolstoy,
"Try to be the master over greed, sloth, lechery, and rage.",leo tolstoy,
"Abstention cannot be achieved at once, but it should be a process, and a constant effort. The life of a person who makes this effort is directed not to the calming of his passions but to the mastery of them.",leo tolstoy,
Time and persistence help you in these efforts.,leo tolstoy,
"The truth is not only a joy, it is an instrument in conflict much more powerful than violence.",leo tolstoy,
"If you have parted from a person, and he was not satisfied with you, or did not agree with you when you were right, he is not to blame, but probably it is you who are to blame, because you were not kind enough with this man.",leo tolstoy,
"To repent means to show your vices and weaknesses to all. Repentance means taking responsibility for all of the bad things you have done, purifying your soul, and preparing to accept goodness.",leo tolstoy,
"When a kind man does not accept his mistakes and tries always to justify himself, he becomes an unkind man.",leo tolstoy,
"Do you have qualities which can be criticized and improved? Try to admit that this is so, and to find these qualities out by yourself.",leo tolstoy,
A man will always understand his sins as well as his limits in this limitless world.,leo tolstoy,
"Science can be divided into an infinite number of disciplines, and the amount of knowledge that can be pursued in each discipline is limitless. The most critical piece of knowledge, then, is the knowledge of what is essential to learn and what isn’t.",leo tolstoy,
Beware of false knowledge. All evil comes from it.,leo tolstoy,
"Knowledge is limitless. Therefore, there is a minuscule difference between those who know a lot and those who know very little.",leo tolstoy,
"The only real life is one lived close to God. This does not happen by itself; you must make an effort to make this happen, and this effort will bring you joy.",leo tolstoy,
"Spiritual effort and the joy that comes from understanding life go hand in hand like physical exertion and rest. Without physical exertion, there is no joy in rest; without spiritual effort, there can be no joyful understanding of life.",leo tolstoy,
"When I die, only one of two things can happen: either this essence which I understand as myself will transform into a different being, or I will stop being a separate individual and become a part of God. Either possibility is good.",leo tolstoy,
Death is the destruction of this body with which I understand the world in this life. It is the destruction of the glass through which I look at the world. And we do not know whether this glass will be replaced by another; or whether the essence which looks through the window will integrate with the world. We cannot know this.,leo tolstoy,
"You should live your life so that you are not afraid of death, and at the same time do not wish to die.",leo tolstoy,
Life should and can be limitless joy.,leo tolstoy,
"Life in this world is not a vale of tears, not a trial, but a thing that surpasses our imagination. Life could be limitless joy, if we would only take it for what it is, in the way it is given to us.",leo tolstoy,
"A person’s unfriendly attitude to other people makes life unhappy, both for that person and for those who surround him. A friendly mood and loving attitude are as an oil which lubricates the wheels of life, making them move easily and smoothly.",leo tolstoy,
A truly wise man is always joyful.,leo tolstoy,
"The best way to live joyfully is to believe that life was given for joy. When joy disappears, look for your mistake.",leo tolstoy,
"It is difficult to avoid working in life without either sinning, committing violence, being a party to violence, or by flattering and pleasing the agents of violence.",leo tolstoy,
You will find that people unwilling to work will either take advantage of others or be humiliated by them.,leo tolstoy,
"People involve themselves in countless activities which they consider to be important, but they forget about one activity which is more important and necessary than any other, and which includes all other things: the improvement of their soul.",leo tolstoy,
"“Be perfect, as your Father in heaven is perfect.” This means that you should try to find the presence of the Holy Spirit in your soul.",leo tolstoy,
"To improve ourselves, to move toward that goal, perfection, that puts no less a demand on us for being unattainable, requires solitude, removal from the concerns of everyday life. And yet constant solitude renders self-improvement impossible, if not pointless. A balance must be struck between meditating in solitude and then applying this to your everyday life.",leo tolstoy,
"To repay evil with goodness is easier, wiser, and more natural than to repay evil with evil.",leo tolstoy,
Those who take joy in repaying an evil with goodness will always try to experience this joy again.,leo tolstoy,
"People think that if they call mass murder “war,” then mass murder will stop being a murder, a crime.",leo tolstoy,
"And because lawlessness is increased, most people’s love will grow cold.",leo tolstoy,
"Murder is always a crime, no matter whom, and how it is justified.",leo tolstoy,
Love of goodness and faith in immortality are inseparable.,leo tolstoy,
"We live in this world like a child who enters a room where a clever person is speaking. The child did not hear the beginning of the speech, and he leaves before the end; and there are certain things which he hears but does not understand. In the same way, the great speech of God started many, many centuries before we started learning, and it will continue for many centuries after we turn to dust. We hear only part of it, and we do not understand the biggest part of what we hear, but nevertheless, a bit vaguely, we understand something great, something important.",leo tolstoy,
"If you truly love goodness (God), then you cannot have doubts in your immortality.",leo tolstoy,
The holy spirit which exists in people is liberated more and more. This will change our existing world order.,leo tolstoy,
Real science shows us how to apply our religious faith to our outer Uves. Art shows us how to apply it to our feelings.,leo tolstoy,
"The more we understand our divine nature, the more its rules should be fulfilled in our actions.",leo tolstoy,
"Everything is connected more closely in the spiritual world than in the material world. Every lie brings multiple lies, every cruelty brings more cruelty.",leo tolstoy,
"Be attentive to the appearance of evil. There is an inner voice in your soul which always tells you about approaching evil You feel unpleasant, you feel ashamed. Believe in this voice; stop and seek to improve yourself, and then you will defeat evil.",leo tolstoy,
"At a certain level of self-awareness, a person understands something supernatural in himself.",leo tolstoy,
God exists only for those who look for Him. Start looking: you will find Him in you and yourself in Him.,leo tolstoy,
"It is surprising that I could not see a very simple truth: behind and above this world and our lives, there is someone who knows why this world exists and why we exist in this world. And our lives are as bubbles in boiling water, which appear, rise to the surface, pop, and disappear.",leo tolstoy,
"Just because a person does not understand God, he has no right to draw the conclusion that God does not exist.",leo tolstoy,
"We understand the divine, spiritual beginning of our life both with our intellect and with our love.",leo tolstoy,
"A man is wise who does three things: first, he does by himself those things which he advises others to do; secondly, he does not do anything that contravenes the truth; and thirdly, he is patient with the weaknesses of those who surround him.",leo tolstoy,
Investigate everything: believe only in those things which exist in accordance with intellect.,leo tolstoy,
"A clever person cannot be evil. A kind person is always clever. Improve your kindness by exercising your intellect, and improve your intellect by exercising your kindness and love.",leo tolstoy,
We cannot hope to obtain any sort of perfection in a society which is divided into two parts: rich people who rule the world and poor people who obey their orders.,leo tolstoy,
It is worse to be an oppressive master than an obedient slave. Excessive wealth is worse than poverty.,leo tolstoy,
"The consequences of our notions cannot be known to us, because they ripple outward limitlessly in a limitless world.",leo tolstoy,
Our most important actions are those consequences which we will not see.,leo tolstoy,
"If you can see all of the consequences of your actions, then your actions are of no use.",leo tolstoy,
"To accept the dignity of another person is an axiom. It has nothing to do with subduing, supporting, or giving charity to other people.",leo tolstoy,
The smallest detail can benefit the strengthening of character. Do not say that small details are not important; only a person with high morals can see their importance.,leo tolstoy,
"Some of the most religious people in Russia have an interesting habit: they make a low bow to persons to whom they are introduced for the first time. They say they do this to acknowledge the divine spirit that every person has within himself. This is not a widespread tradition, but its foundations are very deep.",leo tolstoy,
"A person should know that he performs true charity not in front of other persons, but before the eternal law of God.",leo tolstoy,
Christianity is the study of the divine beginning in a person.,leo tolstoy,
"Without the clear understanding of the meaning of one’s life, without faith, a person can at any minute deny good and start worshiping evil.",leo tolstoy,
A person cannot have complete understanding of the meaning of life. A person can only know its direction.,leo tolstoy,
"The essence of all religious teachings is love. What is special in Christianity is teachings about love, the clear and exact statement of the major condition of love: nonresistance to evil and violence.",leo tolstoy,
"If you want to be quiet and strong, work and improve your faith.",leo tolstoy,
"What is important is not the quantity of your knowledge, but its quality. You can know many things without knowing that which is most important.",leo tolstoy,
Ignorance in itself is neither shameful nor harmful. Nobody can know everything. But pretending that you know what you actually do not know is both shameful and harmful.,leo tolstoy,
"Vague and complex terminology was created by false scholars. Real, truthful knowledge does not need vague terms.",leo tolstoy,
A man who does not understand the benefit of suffering does not live a clever and true life.,leo tolstoy,
"Without suffering, spiritual growth cannot happen. Suffering often accompanies death, but suffering is also a useful, beneficial condition of life. It is said that God loves those who experience suffering.",leo tolstoy,
"A person who lives a spiritual life cannot help but see that suffering brings him closer to God. Seen in this light, suffering loses its bitter side and becomes bliss.",leo tolstoy,
"For a person who leads a spiritual life, self-sacrifice brings a bliss that far transcends the pleasure of a person who lives by the self-indulgent satisfaction of his animal passions.",leo tolstoy,
"Just as fire blows out candles, good deeds for the benefit of others destroy a selfish life.",leo tolstoy,
"The dark spot in the sunlight that falls on us is the shadow created by our own personalities. We live for ourselves only when we live for others. It may seem strange, but try it, and you will see it from your own experience.",leo tolstoy,
"In the future, the order of the social life of the Christian world will be changed by the replacement of violence and its fears with love and blessing.",leo tolstoy,
"It is a mistake to think that there are times when you can safely address a person without love. You can work with objects without love—cutting wood, baking bricks, making iron—but you cannot work with people without love. In the same way as you cannot work with bees without being cautious, you cannot work with people without being mindful of their humanity. It is the quality of people as it is of bees: if you are not very cautious with them, then you harm both yourself and them. It cannot be otherwise, because mutual love is the major law of our existence.",leo tolstoy,
You should live so that it is possible to create the kingdom of love on earth. You should live a life based not on violence but on love.,leo tolstoy,
The greatest knowledge is self-knowledge. He who understands himself will understand God.,leo tolstoy,
"A person can transform his personality, his inner self, from the domain of suffering and subduing into the domain which is always steady and joyful, that is, the domain of understanding his spiritual and divine essence.",leo tolstoy,
Real goodness is always simple.,leo tolstoy,
Simplicity is so attractive and so profitable that it is strange that so few people lead truly simple lives.,leo tolstoy,
"Every great thing is done in a quiet, humble, simple way; to plow the land, to build houses, to breed cattle, even to think—you cannot do such things when there are thunder and lightning around you. Great and true things are always simple and humble.",leo tolstoy,
No one looks less simple than those people who artificially strive to seem so. Artificial simplicity is the most unpleasant of all artificial things.,leo tolstoy,
In any struggle true bravery lies within those who know that God is their ally.,leo tolstoy,
"Whatever happens, do not lose faith. Nothing bad can happen to you as a human being.",leo tolstoy,
"Only a person who renounces his personality becomes truly powerful. As soon as one denies his personality, it is not he but God who acts through him.",leo tolstoy,
"Once upon a time, a Roman empress lost her precious jewelry. It was announced across the empire that whoever found her lost stones before thirty days would receive a big reward, but any who returned the jewelry after thirty days would be executed. Samuel, a Jewish rabbi, found the precious stones, but he returned them after thirty days had passed. “Have you been abroad?” the Roman empress asked him. “No, I was at home.” “Maybe you did not know what was proclaimed?” “No, I knew,” said Samuel. “Then why did you not return these things before the expiry of the thirty days? Now you have to be executed.” “I wanted to show you that I returned your lost jewelry, not because of fear of your punishment, but because of fear of God.”",leo tolstoy,
"A person can understand himself as a material or a spiritual being. When you understand yourself as a spiritual being, then you are free.",leo tolstoy,
"What is “love of God,” if it is not the effort to add part of yourself to the higher creative flow of energy in this world? Divine force exists in everything, but the greatest manifestation of it in this world is in humanity, and in order to put it to work, one must understand it and accept it.",leo tolstoy,
"If a person does not believe himself capable of doing the best things in the world, then he starts to create the worst things.",leo tolstoy,
The understanding of the existence of God is accessible to everybody; the complete understanding of the essence of God is not accessible to any person.,leo tolstoy,
"Live in God, live together with God, by understanding Him in you, and do not try to define Him with words.",leo tolstoy,
"A bad mood is often the reason for blaming others; but very often blaming others causes bad feelings in us: the more we blame others, the worse we feel.",leo tolstoy,
"One of our most common and widespread prejudices is that every person has a fixed, special characteristic, that there are kind people and evil, clever people and stupid people, and cold or hot people. But people are not like this; we can say about a person only that he is more often kind than evil, more often clever than stupid, more often cold than hot. We always divide people like this, but it is no less wrong.",leo tolstoy,
"If there is animosity between two people, both are to blame. Any number you multiply by zero, however big, will equal zero. If there is animosity, then, it is the animosity of two people toward each other, and it exists in both of them.",leo tolstoy,
"If you are living with another person, make an agreement that as soon as either of you starts to blame the other, you will end the argument.",leo tolstoy,
"Work is the necessary condition of happiness. First, favorite and free work; secondly, the physical work which arouses your appetite and afterward gives you tranquil and sound sleep.",leo tolstoy,
"Manual labor does not exclude intellectual activity, but improves its quality and even helps it.",leo tolstoy,
"Work is necessary. If you want a good disposition of your spirit, work until you become tired. But not too much. Not until you become exhausted. A good spiritual disposition can be destroyed by excessive work as well as by idleness.",leo tolstoy,
A person can fulfill his purpose in life equally as well in illness as in health.,leo tolstoy,
"If we meditate upon the existence of life after death, then all illnesses would seem to be taking us closer to the movement from one life to another, a transfer more desirable than undesirable. During these pains we can understand and explain for ourselves what will happen to us, and prepare for the new state of our next existence.",leo tolstoy,
"Usually people think that it is possible to serve God and humanity only when you are healthy. This is not true. Very often it is to the contrary. Christ served God and all mankind when he suffered on the cross, and even then he forgave those who killed him. Every person can do likewise. You cannot say which state is better, a healthy or ill state, in the service of God and humankind.",leo tolstoy,
"For yourself, and for yourself only, it is necessary to have health and power. But to serve God it is not necessary, and sometimes even the opposite is true.",leo tolstoy,
"Very often, when I have dealt with terminally ill people, I have learned that the most important thing is not hiding the approaching death from the patient, but on the contrary, explaining to him his own divine, spiritual nature, which grows in him and which cannot be destroyed by death.",leo tolstoy,
"Illnesses almost always destroy one’s physical power, and they release the power of one’s soul. For a person who concentrates his consciousness in the spiritual domain, illnesses do not diminish his goodness, but on the contrary, they increase it.",leo tolstoy,
It seems that it is impossible to live without discovering the purpose of your life. And the first thing which a person should do is to understand the meaning of life. But the majority of people who consider themselves to be educated are proud that they have reached such a great height that they cease to care about the meaning of existence.,leo tolstoy,
The real purpose of our existence is to understand this limitless life existing in this world.,leo tolstoy,
"A person may not know the purpose of his life, but he should knowhowto live.",leo tolstoy,
"A worker at a big plant may not necessarily know the purpose of his labor, but if he is a good worker, he should know how to do well what he should do.",leo tolstoy,
"Every living being has sensory organs which reveal to it its place in the world. For a human, the primary sense is the intellect.",leo tolstoy,
"If you do not know your place in the world and the meaning of your life, you should know that there is something to blame; and it is not the social system, or your intellect, but the way in which you directed your intellect.",leo tolstoy,
He who sees his life as a process of spiritual perfection does not fear external events.,leo tolstoy,
"People very often do not accept the truth, because they do not like the form in which the truth is presented to them.",leo tolstoy,
"One should avoid disputes; when afire becomes too big, it is difficult to quell it.",leo tolstoy,
"If you know the truth, or if you think that you know the truth, try to pass it on to the others, as simply as you can, along with the feeling of love for those persons to whom you pass it.",leo tolstoy,
The life of Jesus Christ is very important for us as an example of a life of one who could not see the fruits of his work during his lifetime.,leo tolstoy,
"Every person has only one purpose: to find perfection in goodness. Therefore, only that knowledge is necessary which leads us to this.",leo tolstoy,
"Every thought which is expressed by words is a force, and this force is limitless.",leo tolstoy,
"Truth expressed in words is the greatest force there is in the lives of people. We do not understand this force completely, because its consequences are never seen at once.",leo tolstoy,
"Use good thoughts of wise people; if you cannot create similar kind and wise thoughts, then at least do not distribute the false thoughts expressed by you and by others.",leo tolstoy,
"Religious teaching, that is, the explanation of the purpose and meaning of life, should be the basis of any education.",leo tolstoy,
"People think that it is no crime to lie to children, and that to lie to children is not really very wrong, but even sometimes necessary. But it is clear that with children you should be especially careful and honest about what you say to them.",leo tolstoy,
"Do not say to a child whom you teach that there is a final truth, if you do not believe in something completely, or if you have some doubts. To do such a thing is a great crime.",leo tolstoy,
Compassion for animals is so natural to us that we can become insensitive to their suffering and death only through traditions or hypnosis.,leo tolstoy,
"A person who tries to find good outside himself, either in this life or in the one to come, is making a mistake.",leo tolstoy,
Nothing can give a man strength when he is looking for salvation other than his own effort.,leo tolstoy,
There is nothing more attractive than humbleness and kindness. But you should not seek kindness which advertises itself.,leo tolstoy,
"A wise man was told that he was considered to be a bad person. He answered, “It is good that they do not know everything about me, because otherwise they could say worse things about me.”",leo tolstoy,
"Try to avoid making judgments about yourself, especially by comparing yourself with others. Compare yourself only with perfection.",leo tolstoy,
Life is constant change; it ought to consist of weakening the material and increasing the spiritual side of our existence.,leo tolstoy,
The kindness of a dove is not virtue. A dove is not more virtuous than an eagle. Virtue begins only when there is an effort.,leo tolstoy,
"We cannot stop on the way to self-perfection. As soon as you notice that you have a bigger interest in the outer world than in yourself, then you should know that the world moves behind you.",leo tolstoy,
"Only spiritual things exist in reality, and the material world is only an illusion.",leo tolstoy,
"If you want to save your soul, forget about your comfort.",leo tolstoy,
"Truly, only those things which are spiritual are real. Those things which can be seen and felt are only an illusion.",leo tolstoy,
"It seems to us that the most clear, understandable, and obviously existing things are not all there is. There is something else: unclear, unknown, contradictory, and nonexistent.",leo tolstoy,
"The moving force of all perfection, both for individuals and for whole nations, is not the understanding of what exists in this world, but the understanding of what can be achieved.",leo tolstoy,
"The weaker my hands, the more effort I should make to achieve perfection.",leo tolstoy,
You must be as perfect as your father in heaven.,leo tolstoy,
The perfection of the highest kindness is the goal for which all mankind strives. Christian learning about perfection is a tool for all mankind.,leo tolstoy,
"A person who sails far from the shore can see some shore-lines or cliffs. But when sailors go really far away from the shore, they can be guided only by the stars high up in the sky, and the compass which indicates their direction, and both these things are given to us.",leo tolstoy,
"No matter how low a person may fall, he will always be able to see that perfection toward which he should move.",leo tolstoy,
"Life is the constant approach to death; therefore, life can be bliss only when death does not seem to be an evil.",leo tolstoy,
"Remember, you do not live in the world, you only pass through it.",leo tolstoy,
Every person should decide questions of life and death for himself.,leo tolstoy,
"The intellect questions, how and why? The dove does not ask, it says: I am love. It gives satisfaction without asking questions.",leo tolstoy,
Fear nobody and nothing. That which is the most precious matter in you can be damaged by no one and by nothing.,leo tolstoy,
"Truth is not virtue, but the lack of vices.",leo tolstoy,
"The most common and the most widely used deceit is the wish to deceive not other people, but yourself. And this kind of life is the most harmful.",leo tolstoy,
One of the most common mistakes is to think that you can live without truth. The inner and outer consequences of even the smallest lies are usually more harmful than those small unpleasant things which result from telling the truth directly.,leo tolstoy,
Humanity has never lived and cannot live without religion.,leo tolstoy,
Religion is the necessity and prime condition of the life of an intellectual person.,leo tolstoy,
"The stronger the religious feeling is, the better one understands what is and what should be the guide of all one’s actions.",leo tolstoy,
"People often say that religion loses its power amidst humanity. This is not true, and this cannot be true. This happens because the people who think so observe only a small group of people, and there are always certain people who do not have religious feelings.",leo tolstoy,
"If a person has problems, there can he only one root cause: lack of faith. The same is true within human societies as a whole.",leo tolstoy,
"The greatest joy, according to the works of Francis Assisi, is that you can endure everything, you can even suffer slander and physical pain, and at the end you are able to feel no animosity toward these sufferings, but you feel joy, because you have faith; such joy cannot be destroyed, either by evil people or by your own suffering.",leo tolstoy,
"When they blame you and scold you and discuss you, then you should rejoice; when they praise you and admire you, then you should be sad.",leo tolstoy,
Libel and a false reputation which you can destroy is the best school of goodness.,leo tolstoy,
"The blaming and criticism of other people is bad. But at the same time it is understandable, and it is valuable as the only test of your love for God and your neighbor.",leo tolstoy,
"One cannot say that the understanding of the divine essence of your soul gives you power, for this understanding raises you to that level which transcends any notions of force or weakness and therefore of power.",leo tolstoy,
"Who can harm you, who can be more powerful than you, if you are united with God? And can do this.",leo tolstoy,
The foundation of all faiths is the same.,leo tolstoy,
"It only seems that people are busy with trade, with making agreements, negotiations and wars, science and the arts. There is in fact only one thing which people do; this is to search for the understanding of the moral law by which they live. And this understanding is not only the most important but the only real concern for all humankind.",leo tolstoy,
"When you clash with other people, remember the law of reciprocity. You should do to others those things which you want done to you. This should become your way of life.",leo tolstoy,
"For a person, for an animal, indeed for any living being, there is neither logic nor meaning in the word “freedom” because all our lives are limited by many constraints. And yet if a person understands himself as a spiritual being, he cannot even speak about not being free: the idea of not being free cannot be applied to the notions of intellect, conscience, and love.",leo tolstoy,
"Remember that your understanding of your inner self holds the meaning of your life, and it makes you free if you do not force it to serve your flesh. The human soul which is enlightened by understanding and freed from passions, and lit with the divine light, stands on a firm foundation.",leo tolstoy,
People who deny freedom remind me of blind people who deny colors. They do not know the nature of freedom.,leo tolstoy,
"In order to live in goodness, try doing it.",leo tolstoy,
"You should celebrate each new day with a good action, a good deed. This is the best way to start a new day.",leo tolstoy,

"If you cannot teach yourself to seek possibilities for doing good and to do good at every possible occasion, then at least do not miss a chance to do good.",leo tolstoy,
"The greatest changes in the world are made slowly and gradually, not with eruptions and revolutions.",leo tolstoy,
The same things happen in one’s spiritual life.,leo tolstoy,
All really great things are happening in slow and inconspicuous ways.,leo tolstoy,
"There is nothing more harmful for your inner perfection than the understanding that you are doing well. The way to happiness, the way to real moral improvement, moves so invisibly, so inconspicuously, that a person can see his successes only after great, lengthy periods of time.",leo tolstoy,
"If you think that you are moving toward perfection and you notice this, then you should know that you are mistaken, that you have stopped and are moving backward.",leo tolstoy,
"We should be satisfied with the small things in life. The less we need, the less trouble we can have.",leo tolstoy,
"Nature needs small things, but your imagination needs much.",leo tolstoy,
"The growth of your desires is not the way to perfection, as many people think. To the contrary, the more a person limits himself, the better he can understand his human dignity, and the more free, the more brave he becomes, and most importantly, the more capable of serving God and other people.",leo tolstoy,
Love is one of the manifestations of God in man.,leo tolstoy,
The purpose of life is to express love in all its manifestations.,leo tolstoy,
"In order to be happy, you should love—love with self-sacrifice, love all and everything, and spread a network of love everywhere. No matter who gets into this net, catch them all and fill them with love.",leo tolstoy,
"Everyone can recall a moment, universal to all, perhaps from early childhood, when you wanted to love everyone and everything—your father, your mother, your brothers, evil people, a dog, a cat, grass—and you wanted everyone to feel good, everyone to feel happy; and even more, you wanted to do something special so that everyone would be happy, even to sacrifice yourself, to give your life so that everyone should feel happy and joyful. This feeling is the feeling of love, and it must be returned to, for it is the life of every person.",leo tolstoy,
Anything you do should he filled with love.,leo tolstoy,
There is no worse harm for a person with a strong intellect than the temptation to make witty remarks that blame and mock his neighbors.,leo tolstoy,
"Making jokes and blaming and mocking others is like covering a dead body with a nice sauce and presenting it as a meal. Without the sauce, you would turn away, but with it, you find you can easily eat this distasteful meal.",leo tolstoy,
Never listen to those who blame others and speak well about you.,leo tolstoy,
"You have to think about what you say; only then will you feel quiet and kind and filled with love. The more you are irritated, the more excited you become, the more care you must exercise not to sin with your words by abusing others.",leo tolstoy,
"Christ’s greatest words were said immediately before his death, when he forgave his persecutors, who did not understand what they did. The words and actions of a dying person have great power over people, and thus it is important both to live a good life and to die in a good way. A good death takes away the sins of a bad life.",leo tolstoy,
"During the minutes of death, a person can see a candle, in the light of which he reads the book of a life filled with problems, lies, evils, and misfortunes. And, in the minutes of dying, this candle lights up all the world with a very bright and clear light, and brightens up all the corners of a person’s life, even those corners which were always covered with darkness; and then it makes some slight noise, and the light goes down and disappears forever.",leo tolstoy,
"When you get ready to die, do not worry about the usual things, like following rituals or taking care of everyday business. Be prepared so that you can die in the best way possible. Use all the mighty influence of those powerful strong minutes of death, when a person exists partially in the other world, and his words and deeds have special power over those who remain in this world.",leo tolstoy,
"Very often, all of the activity of the human mind is directed not in revealing the truth, but in hiding the truth. The potential of the human mind to act this way is our major source of temptation.",leo tolstoy,
"The court jury has, as its raison d’âtre, the task of preserving society as it exists now, and therefore, it persecutes and executes those who stand higher than the general level of society, and it serves those who are lower than the general level.",leo tolstoy,
"If you see that an action is explained by a very sophisticated reasoning, then you can be sure that this action is bad. The decisions of the conscience are always strict and simple.",leo tolstoy,
"For the pagan world, a man’s richness indicates his glory and importance; in a truly Christian world, the great wealth of a man is an indication of his weakness and lies.",leo tolstoy,
"The possession of great wealth is a school of pride, cruelty, self-admiration, and dissipation.",leo tolstoy,
"You should not respect poor people too much, but you should take pity on them. A rich person should not be proud of his wealth; he should be ashamed of it.",leo tolstoy,
Life is the understanding of a holy spirit in yourself; a holy spirit which is put into some limits.,leo tolstoy,
"Under my feet, there is cold frozen earth; around me huge trees are standing; above my head is the foggy cold sky. I feel my body, I feel my mind occupied with various thoughts. And at the same time I know that all these things, all this frosted cold earth, and the trees, and the sky, and my body, and my thoughts, this is all created by chance, this is a temporary world, the creation of my five senses. The world created by me exists only because I am part of it, and therefore, I separate myself from the world. I know that I could die, but the world will not disappear.",leo tolstoy,
"Death will make some changes in me, and while I will not be completely destroyed, I will become another being, separate from this world. Now, at present, I understand myself; then, something different altogether will happen to my inner self. And there can be a limitless number of such beings, which exist separately from this world.",leo tolstoy,
Our life is our limited understanding of this eternal and limitless spirit which knows no constraints in time and space and which is not bound by any spatial or timely events.,leo tolstoy,
The human conscience is a divine conscience.,leo tolstoy,
"Our land, like our character, cannot be the object of buying and selling. Behind the buying and selling of earth is the hidden process of buying and selling a personality.",leo tolstoy,
"A person in our society cannot sleep without paying for the place where he sleeps; he has the right to have free air or water or sunlight only when he is on the road. The only right he has is to walk along this road; until he becomes tired, or he cannot walk, he has to continue walking.",leo tolstoy,
"People strive in this world, not for those things which are truly good, but for the possession of many things which they can call their property.",leo tolstoy,
"A person who is not used to luxury, but who acquired luxury quite by chance, often pretends, in order to become more important in his own eyes and in the eyes of other people, that luxury is natural for him, that he is not surprised by it, that he neglects it. In the same way a stupid person pretends that he is bored with life, and that he can find something more interesting.",leo tolstoy,
You must believe in the possibility of happiness in order to be happy.,leo tolstoy,
"Take from a person who follows the divine law everything which other people think of as comfort and wealth, and nevertheless such a person will remain happy.",leo tolstoy,
A person who has spoiled his stomach will criticize his meals saying that the food is bad; the same thing happens with people who are not satisfied with their lives in this world.,leo tolstoy,
"We do not have the right to be unhappy with our life. If it seems to us that we are not satisfied with life, we should see this as a reason to be unsatisfied with ourselves.",leo tolstoy,
Better to do nothing than to do harm.,leo tolstoy,
"We often refuse to participate in the innocent joys of life because we are too busy with something we feel we have to do. We should accept these moments, because the sweet and joyful game is sometimes more important and necessary than most other things. Very often the business which busy people claim to be doing is not important at all, and sometimes it would be better left undone.",leo tolstoy,
"Cruel people are busy all the time, as if to find justification for the cruelty of their dealings.",leo tolstoy,
"It is a common misconception to think that pleasures and joys are unimportant and sometimes evil; as for example, Islam, or ancient old Orthodox Christianity, or Puritanism would have it. Pleasure is as important as work, and is the reward of work. Work cannot last endlessly, and the necessary rest should usually conclude with some period of pleasure.",leo tolstoy,
"Pleasures are only bad in these three cases: when we have to make other people work for us because it is impossible for us to satisfy our desire for pleasures, when we plan competitive games to determine who will have the best or the most pleasures, and when pleasures are allowed only for selected people. But if these evils are avoided, then pleasure, especially for young people, is not an evil, but a good.",leo tolstoy,
"Work and pleasure should be alternated, one after the other; they fill our lives with joy, though not every work and every pleasure can do this.",leo tolstoy,
"No exterior force can make you humble. There is only one way to be humble: do not think about yourself, but about how you can serve God and others.",leo tolstoy,
"Whether they know it or not, all creatures are inseparably connected.",leo tolstoy,
Individual goodness and individual evil both have the power to spread goodness or evil throughout the world.,leo tolstoy,
"Due to the current distortion, perversion, and false understanding of Christianity, our lives have become worse than those of pagans.",leo tolstoy,
"A man should be a servant, and he should make a choice of whose servant he is: if he is the servant of his passions, then he is a servant of other human beings, but if he is the servant of his inner divine spirit, then he is a servant of God alone.",leo tolstoy,
It is better to have a superior master.,leo tolstoy,
"The more respect that different objects, customs, or laws are given, the more attentively you have to question the right these things have to this respect.",leo tolstoy,
"Uprooting the existing evils of this life can begin only by making our religions open, so that every single human being in the world can reveal religious life and can discuss and create and discover religious truth.",leo tolstoy,
"If we say that the outer world exists only as we see it, we deny that there are other beings, with senses different from our own.",leo tolstoy,
"When I cast my gaze on objects, I try to correlate their outlines with ideas that already exist in my head. I will see white on the horizon, and I will think, There is a white church in the distance. Do we not give everything we see in this world a preexisting form from our imagination, brought by us from our previous life?",leo tolstoy,
"In reality, the outer world in itself is not as we see it, and thus everything material in this world is insignificant. What is important then? That thing which exists everywhere, at all times, and for all people: the divine spark, the spiritual root of our lives.",leo tolstoy,
An evil deed not only destroys the soul but often returns to bring evil on the evildoer.,leo tolstoy,
"Sinning is as dangerous as irritating a wild beast. In most cases in this world, evil returns to the evildoer in the worst and rudest form.",leo tolstoy,
Calmness and humility provide pleasures which are not accessible to the selfish and the proud.,leo tolstoy,
"The prerequisite of a good life is peace between people, and the major obstacle to peace is pride. A person should be humble, prepared to be falsely accused, ready for everything; only then can he bring peace into his relationships and into the lives of others.",leo tolstoy,
"Pride defends itself, and not only itself but other sins, and it hates humility, so it rejects the cure, and hides and justifies the sin. The understanding of sin has a positive influence on a person; it is even more useful than a good deed, which can increase pride.",leo tolstoy,
Do not be afraid to be humiliated if you can accept this with humility—you will be repaid many times in the spiritual blessings which are connected with being humble.,leo tolstoy,
Without truth there is no kindness; without kindness the truth cannot be told.,leo tolstoy,
Disguising yourself as a kind person is worse than being nakedly mean.,leo tolstoy,
"Christian society, as it now exists, doesn’t follow Christian law in its real meaning.",leo tolstoy,
"Almost every effort of the human mind is directed, not toward lightening the work of the laborer, but toward making more pleasant the idleness of the leisured.",leo tolstoy,
"It defies the laws of nature for a child to rule an adult, or a fool to guide a wise man. Likewise, it is against the law of nature that a small group of people should be overindulged when a huge, hungry crowd’s most basic needs aren’t met.",leo tolstoy,
There is only one thing in this world which is worth dedicating all your life. This is creating more love among people and destroying barriers which exist between them.,leo tolstoy,
"There is something in the soul which cannot die, which cannot be affected by death.",leo tolstoy,
"People are born and live only as manifestations, or pieces of God; therefore they cannot be completely destroyed. They can disappear from before our eyes, but they cannot be destroyed. One person was within my sight for a long time; another went out of my sight very quickly; but I cannot say that the first person existed more and the second less. It doesn’t matter whether a man passes by my window quickly or slowly. I know definitely that this man existed in the time before I saw him and that he will exist in the time after he has disappeared from my sight.",leo tolstoy,
"Real life exists outside time and space; therefore, death can change the manifestation of life in this world, but it cannot destroy life itself.",leo tolstoy,
"Try to live with the part of your soul which understands eternity, which is not afraid of death. And that part of your soul is love.",leo tolstoy,
"All material changes in our everyday life are small in comparison with those in our spiritual life. There could be a change in feelings and actions, there could be a change in thoughts and ideas. In order to change your thoughts and ideas, you should concentrate your conscious mind on your spiritual requirements.",leo tolstoy,
"We regret losing a purse full of money, but a good thought which has come to us, which we’ve heard or read, a thought which we should have remembered and applied to our life, which could have improved the world—we lose this thought and promptly forget about it, and we do not regret it, though it is more precious than millions.",leo tolstoy,
Suffering is the necessary condition for spiritual and physical growth.,leo tolstoy,
"Very often we say that we don’t like suffering, that we have too much suffering, but sufferings, all kinds of sufferings, are always good for us. Sometimes, we even see that it is useful to suffer: children suffer when they grow, or when it is necessary that they clean an injury filled with filth. We cannot see the usefulness of moral sufferings, but those sufferings, too, make us better and closer to God.",leo tolstoy,
"You should look in suffering for the seeds of your future spiritual growth, or the bitterness of suffering will be severe.",leo tolstoy,
Intellect is the quality that makes us different from animals.,leo tolstoy,
"Buddha said: “In meditation, in speech, in life, in studies, I never forget about the most important thing: the requirements of the intellect.”",leo tolstoy,
The moral and the intellectual are always in harmony.,leo tolstoy,
People spoil their life who neglect their intellect and say that it cannot guide them.,leo tolstoy,
"Intellect is the same in all people, and communication is based on intellect; therefore every man must correspond to its requirements.",leo tolstoy,
"When you make an effort not to blame other people, your life becomes much easier, but very few people make this small effort.",leo tolstoy,
"In the lives of the saints, there is the story of the hermit who saw in his dream a monk who had died long ago, and who had been rather weak in his life. The monk was in an especially lovely and honored part of paradise. The hermit asked, “How were you granted this place, with all your weaknesses?” and the monk answered that it was because he had never blamed, not a single person in his life.",leo tolstoy,
"Unless you yourself are sinless, do not say a single word about the sins of others, but be quiet. If you make it a habit not to blame others, you will feel the growth of the ability to love in your soul, and you will see the growth of goodness in your life.",leo tolstoy,
To love God means to love the highest possible good which we can imagine in all things.,leo tolstoy,
"People often say, “I do not understand love of God; what is love of God?” It would be more exact to say, “cannot understand love in this world without love of God.”",leo tolstoy,
"If you love a person without loving God, which is the goodness inside of him, then you plant the seeds for future disappointments and sufferings with this love.",leo tolstoy,
Those who say that they love God but dislike their neighbors are lying to people; those who love their neighbors but don’t love God are lying to themselves.,leo tolstoy,
"Only perfection is worth complete love. In order to feel complete love, we can either delude ourselves that some imperfect object of our love is “perfection” or we can love perfection, which is God.",leo tolstoy,
The improvement of society can be achieved only by the moral improvement of individuals.,leo tolstoy,
"There can be only one way to fight the general evil of life: it is in the moral, religious, and spiritual perfection of your own life.",leo tolstoy,
"The misfortunes of war and preparations for war bear little relation to the reasons given to explain war: the real reasons are usually so insignificant that they are not even worth discussion, and they are completely unknown to those who die.",leo tolstoy,
"Only during a period of war does it become obvious how millions of people can be manipulated. People, millions of people, are filled with pride while doing things which those same people actually consider stupid, evil, dangerous, painful, and criminal, and they strongly criticize these things—but continue doing them.",leo tolstoy,
"The reasons which governments give for wars are always screens, behind which lie completely different reasons and motives.",leo tolstoy,
"Understanding our duty provides us with the understanding of our divine soul. And, too, the understanding of our divine soul gives us the understanding of duty.",leo tolstoy,
The voice of your conscience is the voice of God.,leo tolstoy,
Your conscience is your understanding of your spiritual origins; only when you possess such awareness will it be a real guide in your life.,leo tolstoy,
"There are two different beings within you, one which is blind and sensual, and another which can see and is spiritual.",leo tolstoy,
"This spiritual being is called conscience and can be compared with the needle of a compass which points at goodness at one end, and at the other, evil. We cannot perceive this compass until we stray from goodness, but as soon as we do something bad, then we feel this pull away from the direction of goodness in life.",leo tolstoy,
Fear all that is not accepted by your conscience.,leo tolstoy,
"In our time, the killing of animals for pleasure or food is almost a crime, and hunting and eating meat are not just trivial things, but bad actions, which like any other bad actions lead to many other actions which are worse.",leo tolstoy,
The misery of the unintellectual life brings us to the need for an intellectual life.,leo tolstoy,
"Before, I lived in sin, and I saw that the majority of people around me lived in the same way. Like a robber, I knew I was unhappy and I suffered, and that people around me were unhappy and they suffered; and I didn’t see any way out of this situation except for suicide or death. Life seemed terrible to me. And then I heard the words of Christ and I understood them. And life ceased to seem an evil, and instead of desperation I felt a happiness for life which surpasses even death.",leo tolstoy,
"When you suffer, think not on how you can escape suffering, but concentrate your efforts on what kind of inner moral and spiritual perfection this suffering requires.",leo tolstoy,
"All the misfortunes of mankind collectively and individually are not useless; they bring people and individuals and nations in different ways closer to the purpose which is set before them: the appearance of God, for every person in himself, and in all mankind.",leo tolstoy,
There is only one true religion for all of mankind.,leo tolstoy,
"We can believe in a thing, we can know that it exists, even if we cannot understand it with our intellect, or explain it with words.",leo tolstoy,
Do not fear hesitations but study the different faiths and religions intellectually.,leo tolstoy,
Only he who accepts that the essence or meaning of his life is not material but spiritual can be free.,leo tolstoy,
"A slave who is happy with his state is a slave twice over, because not only his body but his soul is enslaved.",leo tolstoy,
There is no middle way: either be a slave of people or of God.,leo tolstoy,
Understanding or mindfulness of death teaches one to choose the things which are complete or could be completed; and those things are the most important.,leo tolstoy,
"There is no death for the spirit; therefore, a person who lives a spiritual life is freed from death.",leo tolstoy,
"Whenever you ask whether you should behave in this way or the other, ask yourself, what would you do if you knew that you could die this evening, and nobody would find out about your action? Death spurs people to finish their affairs; among all actions, there is only one type which is complete, and that is love which seeks no reward.",leo tolstoy,
It is very useful to notice the impression which our life and deeds make upon other people.,leo tolstoy,
Never try to justify your deeds.,leo tolstoy,
Love provides a person with the purpose of his life. Intellect shows him the means to achieve that purpose.,leo tolstoy,
"If a person lacks intellect, he can not distinguish bad from good, and so he can neither truly seek nor truly have real goodness.",leo tolstoy,
A good life is given only to those who make efforts to achieve it.,leo tolstoy,
"In order to have a good life, you should not be afraid of any good deeds. You should have no less power or strength for small acts than for the biggest and greatest good deed.",leo tolstoy,
"Try to live a good life in accord with the virtues that are set before you. Perhaps this is a difficult thing, but with time it becomes more and more joyful.",leo tolstoy,
"If you need goodness, follow God’s law. And to follow the law of God is possible only by making an effort. Not only is this effort rewarded with a happy life, but even the effort itself gives the biggest blessing of life.",leo tolstoy,
"The family relationship is only good and firm and giving of virtue to people when it goes beyond family and is also religious, and all the members of the family believe in one God and His law. Otherwise, the family is the source not of pleasure but of suffering.",leo tolstoy,
"One of the most common explanations for bad deeds is the family name. People steal, make bribes, do many other nasty things in life, all of which can be explained by their love for their family.",leo tolstoy,
"Family love is a selfish feeling, and therefore it can justify bad, unworthy actions.",leo tolstoy,
"In family love, in the moral high meaning, there is nothing good or bad, just as in self-love. Both are natural. Love of your family, as well as of yourself, when it surpasses its limits, can be a vice, but it can never be a virtue, because it’s a natural feeling.",leo tolstoy,
"Depression is a state of the soul in which you can see no sense either in your own life or in the life of the world. This state is not only painful for the people around you, but it can influence them, and a truly good person deals with this unpleasantness when he is alone. When you have bad spirits or are in a low mood, or you are irritated, you should be so in solitude.",leo tolstoy,
"When everything you see appears in dark, gloomy shades, and seems baleful, and you want to tell others only bad and unpleasant things, do not trust your perceptions. Treat yourself as though you were drunk. Take no steps and actions until this state has disappeared.",leo tolstoy,
You should never feel depressed.,leo tolstoy,
"A man should always feel happy; if he is unhappy, it means he is guilty.",leo tolstoy,
"O Lord, help me to be always happy and to rejoice following and fulfilling your will.",leo tolstoy,
"Both our physical sufferings and periods of depression are part of our life in this world, and we should patiently wait until they are over, or our life is over.",leo tolstoy,
"As soon as a person asks himself the question, “How do I live my life in the best way?” then all other questions are answered.",leo tolstoy,
"Real living takes place not in the domain of outward change, but in the inner domain, where changes can hardly be observed, in our spiritual life.",leo tolstoy,
"The more people believe that others can improve their lives, the slower any improvement will occur.",leo tolstoy,
The human soul is divine.,leo tolstoy,
"Life is given to us in the same way as a child is given to a nanny, so that it can be raised to maturity.",leo tolstoy,
"Keep yourself in purity, far from evil, so that divine power may come through you. And in this flow of divine power through you, there is great bliss.",leo tolstoy,
"There is no other domain where the words of our language are so misused as in the criticism of art, especially of false art.",leo tolstoy,
"There are two very clear indications of real science and real art: the first inner sign is that a scholar or an artist works not for profit, but for sacrifice, for his calling; the second, outer sign is that his works are understandable to all people. Real science studies and makes accessible that knowledge which people at that period of history think important, and real art transfers this truth from the domain of knowledge to the domain of feelings.",leo tolstoy,
"Creating art is not as elevated a thing as many people guess, but certainly it is a useful and kind thing to do, especially if it brings people together and arouses kind feelings in them.",leo tolstoy,
A person is enslaved to the extent he believes that his life has only a physical beginning.,leo tolstoy,
"If you feel that you are not free, look for the reason inside you.",leo tolstoy,
Punishment is a notion that humankind gradually outgrows.,leo tolstoy,
"A person has done evil, so another person, or a group of people, in order to fight this evil, cannot think of anything better than to create another evil, which they call punishment.",leo tolstoy,
"Every punishment is based, not on logic or on the feeling of justice, but on the desire to wish evil on those who have done evil to you or to another person.",leo tolstoy,
Capital punishment is a very clear proof that our society’s organization is far from being a Christian one.,leo tolstoy,
Everything about our present system of punishments and about all criminal law will be thought of by future generations in the same way that we think of cannibalism or human sacrifice to ancient pagan gods. “How did they not see the uselessness and cruelty of those things which they did?” our descendants will say about us.,leo tolstoy,
"To punish others is like putting more wood in the fire. Every crime already has punishment in itself, and it is more cruel and more just than the punishment created by people.",leo tolstoy,
"We should remember that the desire to punish is part of a very low animal feeling which should be suppressed, and which should not be a part of our reality.",leo tolstoy,
"Follow the best way of life you possibly can, and habit will make this way suitable and pleasant for you.",leo tolstoy,
"Everything is from God; therefore, everything is good. Evil is goodness which we did not understand because of our shortsightedness.",leo tolstoy,
"When one understands that kind of evil which is in his deeds, then all other misfortunes to which he can be subjected are nothing as compared with the pleasure and freedom he can then experience.",leo tolstoy,
"Neither the descriptions of war nor its terrible cruelties and atrocities can stop people from participating in it. One reason for this is that by viewing the atrocities of war, everyone comes to understand that if such a terrible thing can exist and be accepted by people, then there must be some reason for its existence.",leo tolstoy,
The time has come to talk about the evils of war. It is not true that the existence of wars proves their necessity. The history of mankind says that such things should not happen.,leo tolstoy,
To deny God is to deny yourself as a spiritual and intellectual being.,leo tolstoy,
"I know God and soul not by their definition, but in another way entirely. Striving to define God destroys this knowledge in me. I know that God exists, that my soul exists; this knowledge is clear to me because I was given it. I have not the slightest doubt about the existence of God, if I ask: What am I? Who am I? My legs are not me; my arms are not me; my head is not me; my feelings are not me; even my thought is not me. Then what am I? I am myself, I am my soul. No matter which side I approach this question, I inevitably come to God. The beginning of my life is God, the beginning of my existence is God. The same with the soul. If I want to know the truth, I know that at the beginning of all is my soul; if I want to understand my feeling of love and necessity for goodness, then I again find the source of this in my soul.",leo tolstoy,
"Life in this world goes according to somebody’s will—someone performs special actions upon all life in this world, and touches all our lives. That which performs these actions is what we call God.",leo tolstoy,
That feeling which solves all of the contradictions of human life and gives one the greatest bliss is known to all people: this feeling is love.,leo tolstoy,
"Love destroys death and makes it empty; it gives meaning to senseless things; from unhappiness, love makes real happiness.",leo tolstoy,
"The less love a person has, the more he suffers.",leo tolstoy,
"If you are in a difficult situation, a low mood, if you are afraid of other people and of yourself, if you are tormented, then tell yourself: “I will love everyone whom I meet in this life.” Try to follow this rule; and you will see that everything will find its way, and everything will seem simple, and you will no longer have doubts or fears.",leo tolstoy,
People mistakenly think that virtue lies in the knowledge of many things. What is important is not the quantity but the quality of knowledge.,leo tolstoy,
"Do not fear the lack of knowledge, fear false knowledge. All evil in this world comes from false knowledge.",leo tolstoy,
Knowledge born in argument and discussion is to be doubted.,leo tolstoy,
"In the world today, real faith has in most cases been replaced by public opinion. People do not believe in God, but they believe in many minor things which are taught by other people.",leo tolstoy,
"People’s misfortunes are caused not because they do not know their duties, but because they misunderstand their duties.",leo tolstoy,
Faith is not achieved by a majority of votes.,leo tolstoy,
The major reason for the evil that exists today is the absence of faith in people of our time.,leo tolstoy,
Truly virtuous is the person who gives his love to the weak.,leo tolstoy,
"If a rich person could be truly virtuous, then he would stop being rich very quickly.",leo tolstoy,
The foundation of love is in each person’s understanding of the unity of the divine spark which lives in all people.,leo tolstoy,
All that brings unification to people is goodness and beauty; all that brings separation among them is evil. All people know this: it is firmly inscribed on our hearts.,leo tolstoy,
"We are separate beings, it seems, but in our inner life we are closely connected with all living things.",leo tolstoy,
"We can feel some of the vibrations of this spiritual world; some of them have not reached us yet, but they are moving, as the vibrations of light from the distant stars are moving across the universe; they move, though they are not yet visible to our eyes.",leo tolstoy,
The existing order of things can he improved.,leo tolstoy,
"In order to fulfill the law of God as we understand it, a joint effort must be made by many people. Then, maybe slowly, we will move to an understanding of this divine law.",leo tolstoy,
"God’s kingdom is the fulfillment among mankind of God’s will, according to the measure in which it is revealed to us.",leo tolstoy,
"In the life of the world, thousands of years look like one year. Therefore, we should work hard at the fulfillment of eternity, and we should wait for the day when religion will enlighten this world completely.",leo tolstoy,
"The kingdom of God is inside us; therefore look for the kingdom of God inside you and the rest will take care of itself, in the best possible way.",leo tolstoy,
"My material life is subject to suffering and death, and no effort of mine can release me from suffering or death. My spiritual life is subject neither to suffering nor death. Therefore, salvation from suffering and death lies in only one thing: in the transfer of my conscious “self” from the material to the spiritual.",leo tolstoy,
"The way to understand this world is to understand your inner self. With the help of love, and by virtue of the love of others, we understand other beings: people, animals, plants, stones, heavenly bodies; and we understand the attitudes of these beings to themselves; and these attitudes create the whole world as we know it. The way to understanding is based on love, on unification with all other creatures in the world.",leo tolstoy,
That which we understand as the happiness or unhappiness of our animal “self” depends on the highest spiritual will.,leo tolstoy,
"Nothing can support idleness better than empty chatter. People would be better to keep silent and not speak the boring, empty things they routinely say to entertain themselves. How can they endure it?",leo tolstoy,
Those people speak most who do not have much to say.,leo tolstoy,
"The less you speak, the more you will work.",leo tolstoy,
"The foundation of ancient societies was violence. The basis of our contemporary society is wise concord, the negation of violence.",leo tolstoy,
"Some people think that it is impossible to rule other people without violence. And so they do to people as other people do with horses, when they blind their eyes so that they will more obediently walk in a circle.",leo tolstoy,
For what purpose is a man’s intellect if you are going to influence him only with violence?,leo tolstoy,
"In all cases, when people use violence, you should try to convince them not to. You should try to apply wise, convincing arguments, appealing not to the everyday world, but to their higher spiritual understanding. Then, when you succeed, you will have the complete satisfaction of your conscience.",leo tolstoy,
"People believe in eternal life because they believe that life’s beginning is spiritual, and therefore eternal.",leo tolstoy,
"A person is not afraid to die only after he understands that he was never born, that he always existed, exists at present, and will always exist.",leo tolstoy,
"A person will believe in his eternity when he understands that his life is not a wave, a period of time, but the eternal movement which is manifested in this life only as a wave.",leo tolstoy,
Those who believe that their life has not begun with their birth and will not end with death find it much easier to live a good life than those who do not understand or believe this.,leo tolstoy,
"Really true, good, and great things are always simple.",leo tolstoy,
"Very often the simplest and least educated people can easily and unconsciously understand the meaning of life while the most scholarly people lack this ability, because they have been too educated to understand the simple things that are basic to all people.",leo tolstoy,
"If you want to find an example to follow, you should look among simple, humble folk. There is real greatness only in those who do not advertise themselves, and who do not understand themselves as great.",leo tolstoy,
"The feeling of compassion for other living beings reminds me of the feeling of pain in our body. Just as you can become less sensitive to pain in your body with time, you can become less compassionate to others.",leo tolstoy,
"When the suffering of another creature causes you to feel pain, do not submit to the initial desire to flee from the suffering one, but on the contrary, come closer, as close as you can to him who suffers, and try to help him.",leo tolstoy,
"Love is the manifestation of the divine nature which exists above time. Love is not only a way of life, it is an action directed toward the goodness of others.",leo tolstoy,
There is no love in the future. Love can exist only in the present moment. A man who does not manifest love in the present does not love at all.,leo tolstoy,
Be kind even if the world blames you. It is better than the converse when a person is praised by others but continues to be bad.,leo tolstoy,
"Certainly, it is painful to recall all the things which you could have done in the past but did not: some charity, for example; a time you denied to those who expected help from you; or when you blocked the joyful understanding of completing an action you should have finished.",leo tolstoy,
Faith is not true faith if love is not in harmony with it.,leo tolstoy,
"If a person is not in a hurry to fulfill the things which he understands as the law of God, then he believes neither in the law, nor in God.",leo tolstoy,
Effort is the necessary condition of moral perfection.,leo tolstoy,
Those who think that they can live a high spiritual life whose bodies are filled with idleness and luxuries are mistaken.,leo tolstoy,
"If you were abused, make an effort to love those who have abused you. If you have abused someone, make an effort to correct the evil which you created.",leo tolstoy,
"When one understands life’s law, one manifests the part of God which lives inside him.",leo tolstoy,
"In the long run, people achieve only that which they have set as goals for themselves; therefore, set the highest possible goals for yourself.",leo tolstoy,
The fulfillment of the law of goodness has nothing in common with everyday material prosperity. Sometimes material prosperity and moral goodness clash in conflict. These sufferings lead to the highest elevation of spirit.,leo tolstoy,
"Sometimes we cannot see any connection between our suffering and our sin, but this connection definitely exists.",leo tolstoy,
"“I was repaid with evil for the goodness which I have done.” But if you love those for whom you did good, then you have already received your reward. Therefore, all that you do with love, you do for yourself.",leo tolstoy,
"Look for the causes of the evil from which you suffer in yourself. Sometimes this evil is the direct consequence of your activity; sometimes it happens after a lengthy period of transformation of an evil which you committed long ago. But the source is always in you, and salvation from it lies in changes in your actions, your way of life.",leo tolstoy,
"In every faith, only what is spiritual is true.",leo tolstoy,
"If you do not believe that at its beginning, your life came from spirit, why are you looking for it elsewhere, thinking that you can find spirit in other places? He who behaves in this way is like the man who burns a lantern in bright sunlight.",leo tolstoy,
"Do not be afraid to get rid of things which distract your attention—everything material, everything which can be seen or can be felt. The more you purify the spiritual core of your faith, the firmer your faith will be.",leo tolstoy,
"Knowledge is a tool, not a purpose.",leo tolstoy,
"People know little, because they try to understand those things which are not open to them for understanding: God, eternity, spirit; or those which are not worth thinking about: how water becomes frozen, or a new theory of numbers, or how viruses can transmit illnesses. How to live your life is the only real knowledge.",leo tolstoy,
"People who think that the most important thing in life is knowledge remind me of a butterfly who flies into the flame of a candle, and in so doing burns, and extinguishes the light.",leo tolstoy,
"The purpose of life is the fulfillment of the law of God, not the acquisition of ever more knowledge.",leo tolstoy,
Repentance always precedes perfection. It is sad that people think repentance is unnecessary.,leo tolstoy,
Not to accept your mistakes is to increase them.,leo tolstoy,
You should live in such a way that you can confide anything on your mind.,leo tolstoy,
"The more important something is in your life, the more harmful it can be for you in the future if you abuse it. The misfortunes and woes of people often come from the abuse of the most precious tool of our life: intellect.",leo tolstoy,
"God gave his spirit, his intellect, to us, so that we can understand his will and fulfill it; but we misuse it and apply this spirit for the fulfillment of our own will.",leo tolstoy,
When a person tries to apply his intellect to the question “Why do I exist in this world?” he becomes dizzy. The human intellect cannot find the answers to such questions. What does this mean? This means that our intellect is not given to us to find a solution for this question. Our intellect can only answer the question: “How shall I live?” And the answer is simple: “We should live so as to bring good to all people.”,leo tolstoy,
The purpose of the intellect is to reveal the truth; therefore it is a harmful misconception to pervert the truth with intellectual efforts.,leo tolstoy,
Only those who know their weaknesses can be tolerant of the weaknesses of their neighbors.,leo tolstoy,
"Almost always, when we look deep into our souls, we can find there the same sins which we blame in others. If we do not find a particular sin in our soul, then we should look more closely, and we will find even worse sins there.",leo tolstoy,
"If we can put ourselves into the place of other people, we lessen our pride.",leo tolstoy,
"If Christians would follow the law, there would be no rich and no poor.",leo tolstoy,
"Wealth reminds me of manure in the field. When it is in a big pile it makes a bad smell. But when it is distributed everywhere across the field, it makes the soil fertile.",leo tolstoy,
"A person must completely close his eyes on his morals, that in a Christian society so filled with people in need, there are other people who are so proud to have great wealth.",leo tolstoy,
"The intellect can liberate a person; the less of an intellectual life one has, the less liberated one is.",leo tolstoy,
"A wise person lives in accordance with his desires, because he wants only that which is attainable. Such a person is free.",leo tolstoy,
"We have created a way of life which is contrary to mankind’s moral and physical nature, and yet we want to be free while living this kind of life.",leo tolstoy,
"Freedom cannot be achieved by looking for it, but in looking for truth. Freedom should not be a purpose, but a consequence.",leo tolstoy,
Freedom cannot be granted to you by others. Each person can liberate only himelf.,leo tolstoy,
"If you are a material being, then death is the end of everything. But if you are a spiritual being, then the body limits your spiritual being, and death is only a change.",leo tolstoy,
"Our body limits the spiritual divine spark which we call our soul. In the way that a vessel gives form to the liquid or gas which is put into it, our body gives form to our spiritual being. If the vessel is broken, that which was in it no longer retains the form it had and flows out. Does it receive a new form? Is it united with other beings? We know nothing of this. After death the soul becomes something different, something indescribable.",leo tolstoy,
Death is a liberation of the soul from the material personality in which it existed in this world.,leo tolstoy,
"For those who live a spiritual life, there is no death.",leo tolstoy,
"We expect rewards for goodness, and punishments for the bad things which we do. Often, they are not immediately forthcoming. Both evil and good exist in the life of the spirit, though, which is outside time, and though we may not see clear indications of reward or punishment, nevertheless, we feel reward or punishment with our conscience.",leo tolstoy,
The worst punishment is the understanding that you failed to properly use those good things which were given to you. Do not expect a big punishment. There can be no harder punishment than this remorse.,leo tolstoy,
Doing good is the only sure path to bliss.,leo tolstoy,
"Do not expect some tangible reward for your goodness; your actions are their own reward. In the same way, do not think that you can hope to avoid punishment of your evil acts, for your punishment already lies in your soul. You are mistaken if you think that the pain in your soul was caused by anything else.",leo tolstoy,
"Self-abnegation is not the rejection of your entire self, just the rejection of your animal being.",leo tolstoy,
The greatest bliss a person can know is the state of complete freedom and happiness that can come only through self-sacrifice and love.,leo tolstoy,
"Deny your personality, and you will come to understand the highest good in life: love.",leo tolstoy,
"The more a person gives to other people, and the less he asks for himself, the better for him. The less he gives to others, and the more he wants for himself, the worse for him. Our contemporaries think it the reverse.",leo tolstoy,
"For the most part, false and harmful opinions are distributed and supported by influence. We are too likely to accept the views and thoughts of other people without trying to investigate them deeper and further ourselves. Unimportant people are those who accept other people’s thoughts without developing them themselves.",leo tolstoy,
Your thought is easily influenced by the presence of another soul; a person can be completely free only when he is alone.,leo tolstoy,
Nothing is more harmful than a bad example set by others. They bring into our life notions which never would have occurred to us without an example.,leo tolstoy,
"A person can easily grow accustomed to living a lie, especially if he sees everyone around him living in the same way.",leo tolstoy,
False ideas which gain currency can easily be recognized by the loud fanfare with which they are accompanied. Real truth does not need any outer embellishments.,leo tolstoy,
The possibility of influencing others causes a person with high morals to be more strict about his words and actions which could influence other people.,leo tolstoy,
The intellect is the only fit guide for human life.,leo tolstoy,
"A man who lives an intellectual life is like a man who carries a lantern in front of him to light his way. Such a person will never come to a dark place, because the light of his intellect moves before him. There is no fear of death in this kind of life, because the lantern which moves before you lights your way to your last minute, and you follow it to the end as calmly and quietly as you have all of your life.",leo tolstoy,
"Some people live and act according to their own thoughts, and some according to the thoughts of others; this is a crucial distinction between people.",leo tolstoy,
Vanity has no limits.,leo tolstoy,
You could choose no worse way to guide your life than to follow the opinions of other people.,leo tolstoy,
"It’s not wise to be interested in fame and the appreciation of others, because no two people’s opinions about what is good are the same.",leo tolstoy,
The opinion of a revered writer or thinker can have a deep influence on society; it can also be a big obstacle to understanding real truth.,leo tolstoy,
"Divine truth may be revealed in the speech of children, or in the ravings and nightmares of madmen; or in the ordinary conversations of simple people. And weak and false thoughts may be found in books which have come to be considered great, or even sacred.",leo tolstoy,
"Many statements which are accepted as truth because they have been passed down to us by tradition look like truth only because we have never tested them, never thought about them in a more precise way.",leo tolstoy,
"A thought which is expressed in the Old Testament, or in the New Testament, or in the Koran or in the Indian divine book the Upanishads, does not become a truth because it is expressed in a book which is considered to be holy. If we think that every word in every holy book is true, then we have created an idol.",leo tolstoy,
"Any important thought, no matter where it comes from, should be discussed; and every thought, no matter who said it, should be given attention.",leo tolstoy,
"The majority of evils people commit are the result, not of an evil will, but of the dissemination of evil thoughts which people accept and follow uncritically.",leo tolstoy,
"Think only good thoughts, and with time they will become good deeds.",leo tolstoy,
"Thoughts which create evil actions are much worse than the acts themselves. You can stop doing a bad thing, and repent, and not repeat it. But bad thoughts are repeated again and again, and cause other bad actions; bad thoughts follow one after another.",leo tolstoy,
"Think good thoughts, and your thoughts will be turned into good actions. Everything begins in thought. Guiding your thoughts is one of the keys to self-perfection. If you suffer misfortunes in your life, look for their cause, not in your actions, but in the thoughts which inspired them, and try to improve those thoughts. If you are inspired by an event in your life, look for its origins in your previous thoughts which caused the event.",leo tolstoy,
"You make your decisions in the present, and the present exists out of time; it is a tiny moment where two periods—the past and the future—meet. In the present you are always free to make your choice.",leo tolstoy,
"A wise man was asked what was the most important time, person, and thing in life. He answered, “The most important time is the present time, because at this time a person has power over himself. The most important person is the one with whom you deal at present, because there is no guarantee that you will ever be able to deal with any other person in this world. The most important thing is to love this person, because everyone is sent into this world with the sole purpose of loving other people.”",leo tolstoy,
"A most dangerous temptation is the temptation to prepare to live, instead of living. The future does not belong to you. Therefore, remember to live the best way you knownow. The only perfection necessary is perfection in love, which can be reached only in the present. It’s why we came into this world.",leo tolstoy,
The present is the moment in which the divine nature of life is revealed. Let us respect our present time; God exists in this time.,leo tolstoy,
"A person dies as he lives his spiritual life, alone.",leo tolstoy,
"A person may ask God or other people for help, but only his good life can help him, and this he must do on his own.",leo tolstoy,
"Every person has a depth to his inner life, an essence that cannot be explained. Sometimes you want to explain this essence to people, but you will see that it isn’t possible to explain it to another person so that he understands.",leo tolstoy,
Hence the need for your own channel of communication with God. Establish this channel and do not seek anything else.,leo tolstoy,
"The burden, the cross, which every man has to carry exists on two planes: a longer vertical plane, which is the will of God; and a much shorter, horizontal plane, which is a man’s own will. If you orient your will so that it parallels the direction of God’s will, then you will have no cross to carry, no burden.",leo tolstoy,
"If you want to fulfill the will of God, all will be good; if you want to fulfill your own will, and it does not coincide with the will of God, all will be evil.",leo tolstoy,
The only way to know God and to believe in eternity is to unite your own will with the will of God.,leo tolstoy,
"To be wise, you must follow your intellect, even though such a way of life is often attacked.",leo tolstoy,
"You should not be upset by the sight of wisdom being criticized. Wisdom would not be real wisdom if it did not reveal the stupidity of a bad life, and people would not be people if they endured this revelation without criticism.",leo tolstoy,
People have become too accustomed to the use of force. Life without violence seems impossible for them to imagine.,leo tolstoy,
"People are wise beings; they possess the ability to live according to the dictates of their intellect, and sooner or later, they will evolve from a state of violence to a state of complete harmony and understanding. And every act of violence makes this time more distant from today.",leo tolstoy,
"All other arguments against meat eating, no matter how strong they are, are meaningless in relation to the fact that animals have the same life spirit that exists in us.We should feel that by taking an animal life we commit something close to suicide. No other argument against meat eating is necessary for those who have this inner feeling.",leo tolstoy,
We cannot close our eyes to those people who eat meat for the satisfaction of their pampered tastes.,leo tolstoy,
"The logical arguments against meat eating are not strong enough. Logic is good, but in some cases it falls short. But know this: the more compassion a person shows other living creatures, the kinder and better he is. To kill animals, whether for sport or for fuel, is very cruel.",leo tolstoy,
"We are spiritually connected on all sides, not only with people but with all living creatures.",leo tolstoy,
Try to understand the unity of all living things. Try to serve and suffer with all living beings.,leo tolstoy,
Kindness is a necessary addition to everything.,leo tolstoy,
"All the best qualities of mankind are meaningless and worthless without kindness, and even the worst vices can be easily forgiven with kindness.",leo tolstoy,
"There is a natural kindness which comes from our external attributes, from our inheritance, audience, good or bad indigestion, success, etc. This kind of kindness is very pleasant, both for the person who experiences it and for the people around him. And there is another type of kindness which comes from inner, spiritual work. This kindness is less attractive, but although the first kindness can easily change or be transformed into hatred, the second kind of kindness will never disappear and will constantly grow.",leo tolstoy,
"Kindness is the major quality of the soul. If a person is not kind, it is because he was subjected to some lie, passion, or temptation which violated his natural state.",leo tolstoy,
"Christianity is true because it can answer the most distant, abstract questions, and at the same time, it can solve all practical issues of life as well. It established the kingdom of God in the spiritual life of every individual, and in the spiritual life of humanity in general.",leo tolstoy,
"Only religion destroys egoism and selfishness, so that one starts to live life not only for himself. Only religion destroys the fear of death, only religion gives us the meaning of life, only religion creates equality among people, only religion sets a person free from outer pressures. We must believe those spiritual doctrines which provide a very simple and practical guide for every one of us.",leo tolstoy,
"Life is constant movement, and therefore goodness in life is not a certain state, but the direction of movement. This direction is not in serving yourself, but God.",leo tolstoy,
"Happiness is a thing which a person wishes only for himself; goodness is a thing which a person wishes for himself and for others. Happiness can be achieved by struggle; goodness, on the contrary, by being humble.",leo tolstoy,
Real goodness is to serve God.,leo tolstoy,
"You should do goodness without choosing to whom. Good things, once done, will never disappear, even if you forget about them. There is only one way to be happy, and this is a sure way: to do goodness and to share this goodness with others.",leo tolstoy,
Anyone who is engaged in really important things is very simple because he does not have time to create unnecessary things.,leo tolstoy,
People can live without need and without jealousy only when they lead a life of moderation.,leo tolstoy,
"A fruitful prayer is the establishment in your conscious mind of the understanding of life’s meaning, and you can experience this state during the best minutes of your life.",leo tolstoy,
"One hour of honest, serious thinking is more precious than weeks spent in empty talks.",leo tolstoy,
"You should pray every hour. The most necessary and the most difficult form of prayer is to remember—in spite of the numerous distractions of life—your obligations to God, to his law. You become scared, you become upset, you become embarrassed, you become too involved or distracted by something. But you should always remember who you are and what you should do. This is what a real prayer should be about. This is difficult in the beginning, but with time you can work and create this habit.",leo tolstoy,
It is dangerous to disseminate the idea that our life is purely the product of material forces and that it depends entirely on these forces.,leo tolstoy,
"There are no people who can more confuse the notions of good and evil than the scholars of our time. Their science makes good progress in the study of the material world, but in the inner, spiritual life of humanity, it becomes an unnecessary and sometimes harmful thing.",leo tolstoy,
The teaching about your inner life is the most useful one.,leo tolstoy,
In our time science has started to give diplomas for idleness.,leo tolstoy,
"The real purpose of science is the understanding of the truth of this life. Its false purpose is the justification of evil in this world. These are the judicial sciences, political sciences, and especially theology, the science of religion.",leo tolstoy,
"If people were completely virtuous, they would never step aside from the truth.",leo tolstoy,
The truth is harmful only to evildoers. Those who do good love the truth.,leo tolstoy,
"People move, inconspicuously but ceaselessly, toward the kingdom of God, which will be achieved by unification in love.",leo tolstoy,
"The constant struggle between flesh and spirit will never be finished. This struggle is eternal and the essence of life. The purpose of life is loving, the penetration of everything with love. It is the slow and gradual change from evil to good, it is the creation of the real life, the life filled with love.",leo tolstoy,
"The human world is always on the way to perfection, and the understanding of this process of perfection is one of mankind’s biggest joys, and this joy is accessible to every person.",leo tolstoy,
"Work is the condition of existence in the material, physical world. If Robinson had not worked, he would have frozen to death and died from hunger, and everybody can see this. So labor is the necessary condition for the spiritual life as well, but not all people can see this clearly, though it is as obvious as the necessity of physical labor for the body.",leo tolstoy,
"If you are doing nothing, it means you are doing bad things.",leo tolstoy,
"Those who do nothing, do bad things. Those who do nothing, have many associates and supporters. The brain of a lazy and idle person is the favorite stopping place of the devil.",leo tolstoy,
"You should never be ashamed of any work, even the lowest and dirtiest, but you should be ashamed only of the dirtiest moral state, that is the idleness of your body, which is the necessary result of the consumption of the labor of others.",leo tolstoy,
"Justice is achieved not in striving for justice, but with love.",leo tolstoy,
"In order to hit the mark, you should aim farther than it stands, so you will achieve it; in order to be just, you should make a self-sacrifice, be unjust to yourself.",leo tolstoy,
"Not a single person can be completely just in all his deeds, but a just person can be completely different from an unjust one with his efforts, in the same way as a truthful man is different from a liar, with his efforts to speak only truth.",leo tolstoy,
"You cannot be completely just. One time you do too little, the other time you do too much. There is only one way not to sin against justice; always to change things, to improve things, to make them better.",leo tolstoy,
"The best and the most important object for every person is his inner self, his spiritual being.",leo tolstoy,
A person who knows all sciences but does not know himself is a poor and ignorant person. He who does not know anything except for his inner spiritual self is an enlightened person.,leo tolstoy,
"A person always has a place to be safe from all of his misfortunes, and this place is his soul.",leo tolstoy,
"If you could only know who you are, all your troubles would seem utterly unnecessary and trivial.",leo tolstoy,
Faith is the foundation on which all else rests; it is the root of all knowledge.,leo tolstoy,
"There are two types of faith in this world. The first is faith in things other people say, faith in people; there are many varieties of this type of faith. The second is faith in God; this type of faith is unvarying, and it is necessary for all people.",leo tolstoy,
"Faith is the necessary property of the soul. Feel the essential meaninglessness of those things which are well-known to you, and the greatness of things which are unknown but important.",leo tolstoy,
"Cleave to the teachings of Christ completely, and let go of other teachings, just as a sailor reads his compass, though other signs around him might contradict it.",leo tolstoy,
"People who believe they do not have faith are wrong; they simply don’t realize it, or don’t want it, or cannot express it.",leo tolstoy,
"If, in his soul, a person understands God, he understands his connection to all the world’s people.",leo tolstoy,
"We are all children of the same father, and it is unnatural not to love our brothers.",leo tolstoy,
"Those who are on top of the mountain can see the sunrise sooner than those who live in the valley. So, too, with those who achieve spiritual heights: they can see the heavenly sunrise sooner than those who live a material life. But the time will come when the sun will rise so high in the sky that everyone will see it.",leo tolstoy,
"As soon as the higher ideal is put before us, all false ideals will fade away as the stars fade away when they meet the sun.",leo tolstoy,
Any work of false art praised by critics is a door through which “hypocrites of art” enter our minds.,leo tolstoy,
"The creation and sale of most art today is pure prostitution. The comparison is true in every detail. Real art can only rarely be created even by a real artist; like a child in a mother’s womb, it is the ripened fruit of his prior life. False art, though, can be ceaselessly produced by craftsmen, according to the dictates of a market. Like a faithful wife who loves her husband, real art does not need any excess decoration; like a prostitute, false art demands to be decorated. True art comes out of an artist’s urgent need to express the feelings that have formed inside him, just as a mother needs to give birth to her baby. False art answers only to profit. Real art brings new feelings into our life, as a woman brings a new person into the world. False art corrupts: it makes a person dissipated, distracts him, weakens his spiritual power. Everyone must understand this, in order that they shun the terrible proliferation of this dirty, dissipated type of art which is, on its face, prostitution.",leo tolstoy,
"Until they throw the money changers out of the temple of art, it will never be a real temple. But the time will come when these salesmen will be sent away from the temple of art.",leo tolstoy,
"Soldiers who stand idle in a shelter during a battle as reinforcements will try to involve themselves in almost any activity in order to distract themselves from the impending danger. It seems to me that people who want to save themselves from life behave like these soldiers: some distract themselves with vanity, some with cards, politics, laws, women, gambling, horses, hunting, wine, or state affairs.",leo tolstoy,
"It is difficult to imagine what wonderful changes would occur to human lives if people would stop poisoning themselves with brandy, wine, tobacco, and drugs.",leo tolstoy,
"They say that there is one religious sect that at the end of their gatherings they turn down the lights and have an orgy. In our society, people who participate in constant dissipations turn down the light of the intellect with addictive things such as drugs, alcohol, and tobacco.",leo tolstoy,
"Making yourself addicted is not a crime, but it is a preparation for crime.",leo tolstoy,
"Some people say, “It is not important if you drink or smoke.” If it is of no importance, then why not just stop, if you know that you harm yourself and, with your example, others?",leo tolstoy,
"The closer people are to the truth, the more tolerant they are of the mistakes of others.",leo tolstoy,
"Those who don’t believe in the spiritual foundations of their faith, who only pay lip service to the outer shell of their religious rituals, cannot be tolerant of others.",leo tolstoy,
"There is one hard and fast rule we must always remember: if a good end can be achieved only through bad means, either it is not good after all, or its time has not yet come.",leo tolstoy,
"A real truth, a real faith, needs neither worldly support nor an outer glamour, nor does it need to be forcefully introduced to others. God has time; for Him thousands of years pass as one. Those who feel the need to spread their faith through violence and force either lack faith in God, or in themselves.",leo tolstoy,
"God cannot be understood by the human intellect, only felt by the human heart. We only know that he exists, and regardless of whether we want it or not, we know this for sure.",leo tolstoy,
"The intellect is like a light that comes through a translucent glass: I see it, and though I do not know where it comes from, I know that it exists. We can say the same about God.",leo tolstoy,
"We can understand the existence of God with our intellect only when we understand our complete dependence on him, as if we have the same feeling an infant understands when his mother holds him. A baby does not know who feeds him, who warms him, who takes care of him, but he understands that thereissomeone who does this, and even he loves the force in whose power he rests.",leo tolstoy,
"Do not be alarmed if the notion of God is not clearly expressed to you. The more clearly it is expressed, the further it is from the truth, from its foundation.",leo tolstoy,
"Real goodness is not something that can be acquired in an instant, but only through constant effort, because real goodness lies in constantly striving for perfection.",leo tolstoy,
"Strive for goodness without any expectations for rapid or noticeable success. You will not see the results of your efforts, because the further you progress, the higher the ideal of perfection toward which you strive rises. The effort of striving for goodness, the process itself, justifies our lives.",leo tolstoy,
"You should teach others with a good example, but if you teach with evil, then you do not teach, but destroy.",leo tolstoy,
Sinful people had once accepted their right to punish others—and most of our misfortunes started from this.,leo tolstoy,
"If you think someone is guilty of wronging you, forgive him. If you have never forgiven the guilty before, you will experience a new joy: the joy of forgiving.",leo tolstoy,
"Punishment is always cruel, always painful.",leo tolstoy,
"The strongest proof that in the name of “science” we pursue unworthy and sometimes even harmful things is the existence of a science of punishment, which in itself is one of the most ignorant and offensive types of action known to man, a vestige of the lowest level of human development, lower than that of a child or a madman.",leo tolstoy,
"The things we do to make our life more comfortable remind me of an ostrich who hides his head in order not to see his enemies. We behave even worse than an ostrich. In order to achieve some dubious questionable future, we definitely destroy our life in the clearly defined present time.",leo tolstoy,
"People today foolishly try to believe that all the world’s senselessness and cruelty—the richness of the few, the great poverty of the many, the violence and warfare—happens outside their own lives and does not interfere with them and their way of life.",leo tolstoy,
"A misconception remains a misconception, even when it is shared by the majority of the people.",leo tolstoy,
"If life is good, then death which is the necessary part of life, is good as well.",leo tolstoy,
Real life exists only in the present. The future has no meaning.,leo tolstoy,
"The purpose of real life is to fulfill the law of God, which exists eternally: it always existed, it exists now, and it always will exist.",leo tolstoy,
"As soon as you go into the future or the past, you go away from God, and you feel lonely, deserted, and enslaved.",leo tolstoy,
The future does not really exist. It is created by us in the present.,leo tolstoy,
There is a condition in which a person feels himself the architect of his life. It occurs when he concentrates all his efforts and all his intellect on the present moment.,leo tolstoy,
"What time could be better than childhood, and what virtues could be better than innocent joyfulness, and the need for love? They are the purest manifestations of life. You should respect every person, but you should respect a child above all, and not destroy the innocent purity of his soul.",leo tolstoy,
The knowledge we now accept as science interferes with more than it supports the goodness of human life.,leo tolstoy,
"Astronomy, mechanics, physics, chemistry, and all other sciences together and differently, all study the particular sides of life, but they do not come to any conclusion about the spiritual life of mankind.",leo tolstoy,
"No matter how great our knowledge may be, it cannot help us fulfill our life’s major purpose—our moral perfection.",leo tolstoy,
"The voice of conscience makes no mistakes. It wants, not the fulfillment of the animal self, but its denial or sacrifice.",leo tolstoy,
"The voice of your conscience can always be singled out above the noise of your other wishes, because it always wants something seemingly useless, seemingly senseless, seemingly incomprehensible, but at the same time something actually beautiful and good, which can be achieved only through effort.",leo tolstoy,
"The real faith attracts people to itself not because it promises goodness to those who believe, but because it is the only escape, not only from all the problems and troubles and misfortunes of our life, but also from the fear of death.",leo tolstoy,
"If you know that you lack faith, know also that you are in one of the most dangerous situations in this world a person can be in.",leo tolstoy,
It is bad not to have something for which you are ready to die.,leo tolstoy,
"Look at the causes of the misfortunes from which mankind suffers. Push beyond the obvious causes to the root causes, and you will inevitably find that the most basic, the most important cause of each and every one of humanity’s problems is the weakness of faith that comes from a false attitude to the world and its origin.",leo tolstoy,
"Salvation lies not in rituals and not in a particular creed, but in a clear understanding of the meaning of your life.",leo tolstoy,
You cannot serve both god and the devil. Merely tending to the growth of your wealth has nothing to do with the requirements of the truly spiritual life.,leo tolstoy,
It seems to me that the old prejudice that wealth brings happiness has begun to be discredited.,leo tolstoy,
"Do not fear poverty, but beware wealth.",leo tolstoy,
"If only people who seek wealth could clearly see what they would lose by having it, they would put the same amount of effort into getting rid of this wealth as they now put into acquiring it.",leo tolstoy,
"A wise man does not wish to change his situation, because he knows that it is possible to fulfill the law of God, the law of love, in every situation.",leo tolstoy,
"Try to establish an inner silence in yourself, a complete silence of your lips and your heart. Then you will hear how God speaks to us, and you will know how to fulfill His will.",leo tolstoy,
"The more upset a person is with other people, and with circumstances, and the more satisfied he is with himself, the further he is from wisdom.",leo tolstoy,
"Violence is harmful because it is usually dressed in wealth, and it therefore arouses some respect for those things which should arouse disgust.",leo tolstoy,
"People who have power are sure that it is only violence that guides people, and so they use violence to support the existing order. But the existing order is not based on violence, but on public opinion.",leo tolstoy,
All violence is contrary to love: do not participate in violence.,leo tolstoy,
The biggest obstacles to understanding the truth are lies disguised as truth.,leo tolstoy,
The exposure of a lie is as valuable to a community as a clearly expressed truth.,leo tolstoy,
The progress of mankind is in revealing obstacles which are hiding from us.,leo tolstoy,
Doubts do not destroy truth; they strengthen it.,leo tolstoy,
"You will have moments in which you no longer believe in the existence of the spiritual dimension of life. Look at these moments as events in the development of your faith. A person who understands the spiritual nature of life may still at some point become afraid of death, usually for a short period of time, in the same way that you can see as you watch a scene at the theater and forget that you are watching a play, and become scared by what you are seeing as if it were real.",leo tolstoy,
"So it is in real life: in moments of self-delusion, a religious person forgets that what happens in his physical life cannot interfere with what happens in his spiritual life.",leo tolstoy,
"In these periods, when your spirits have fallen, you have to treat yourself as an ill man.",leo tolstoy,
He who hesitates is not distanced from God; it is he who believes unhesitatingly in someone else’s word that God exists or does not exist who is far from God.,leo tolstoy,
The individual ownership of large areas of land is as unjust as the ownership of other people.,leo tolstoy,
"The injustice of owning big pieces of land as prívate property, like any other injustice, is necessarily linked with many other injustices which are used to protect it.",leo tolstoy,
"Life’s essence lies, not in your body, but in your conscience.",leo tolstoy,
"Let your spiritual side guide your material side, and not the other way around. In order to improve his state, a person should strive for spiritual not physical perfection.",leo tolstoy,
Nothing can enlighten people’s lives and ease their burdens more than the understanding that they should serve God.,leo tolstoy,
Pay goodness for evil. We should be like trees that give fruits to those who throw stones at them.,leo tolstoy,
"You should accept yourself, not as a master, but as a servant, and then all your bad feelings, your anxiety, alarm, uncertainty, and dissatisfaction will be changed into calmness and peace. You will be filled inside with a clear vision of your purpose, and with a great joy.",leo tolstoy,
All good things can be achieved only with effort.,leo tolstoy,
A person cries out from pain when he takes up hard physical work after a period of idleness. Any rest from the struggle for spiritual improvement brings the same pain.,leo tolstoy,
The most important and necessary expression of freedom is to give your thought a specific direction.,leo tolstoy,
"Everything is in heaven’s power, except for our choice of whether to serve God or ourselves.",leo tolstoy,
Faith in the existence of eternity is our exclusively human quality.,leo tolstoy,
Death is the destruction of the bodily organs with which I see my world during my life; the destruction of the glass through which I look at this world. The destruction of this glass does not mean the destruction of the eye itself.,leo tolstoy,
Our understanding of eternity is the voice of God who lives within us.,leo tolstoy,
"No matter how big mankind’s store of knowledge seems to me in comparison with our previous ignorance, it is only an infinitely small part of all possible knowledge.",leo tolstoy,
"It is better to know less than necessary than to know more than necessary. Do not fear the lack of knowledge, but truly fear unnecessary knowledge which is acquired only to please vanity.",leo tolstoy,
It would be possible to eat meat if it were justified by any serious considerations. But it isn’t; and meat eating is simply a bad thing that exists without any justification at all.,leo tolstoy,
"If it were not so blindly accepted as a part of our customs and traditions, how could any sensitive person accept the thought that in order to feed ourselves we should kill such a huge number of animals, in spite of the fact that our earth gives us so many different treasures from plants?",leo tolstoy,
"There is a big difference between, on the one hand, a person who does not have access to any food except meat, and on the other, an educated person of today who lives in a country which has vegetables and milk in abundance, and who is instructed against meat eating. The educated person sins greatly if he continues to behave in a way he knows is wrong.",leo tolstoy,
"Work is not a virtue, but it is the necessary condition of a virtuous life.",leo tolstoy,
"Hurried work done in irritation attracts the unfavorable attention of others. Real work is always quiet, constant, and inconspicuous.",leo tolstoy,
"For every idle person, there is another person who works too much. For every person who eats to excess, there is another person somewhere who is hungry.",leo tolstoy,
Much of the activity of idle people who pretend that they are busy with work is merely entertaining; it just adds a burden to other people. This can be said of all luxuriant entertainments.,leo tolstoy,
All true wisdom and all true faith are clearly expressed in the same moral law.,leo tolstoy,
"Moral law is so obvious and clear that even people who do not know the law have no excuse for violating it. They have only one recourse: to deny their intellect, which they do.",leo tolstoy,
"Blaming others is an entertainment which some people like and cannot restrain themselves from. When you see all the harm this blaming causes, you see that it is a sin not to stop people from practicing this entertainment.",leo tolstoy,
"Truth is achieved through discussion, but the wiser man stops the arguments.",leo tolstoy,
"As soon as you start blaming a person, stop yourself. Remember not to say something bad about someone, even if you know it to be true, and especially if you are not certain but are only repeating gossip.",leo tolstoy,
"Most people act, not according to their meditations, and not according to their feelings, but as if hypnotized, based on some senseless repetition of patterns.",leo tolstoy,
"If, among the many voices which speak in my soul, I could only recognize my soul’s true voice, then I would never make mistakes, and never do evil. This is why it is necessary to know yourself.",leo tolstoy,
"If you see that you are not behaving according to your inner desires, but because of some outer influence, stop and consider whether what drives you is good or bad.",leo tolstoy,
"Worse than all the troubles and horrors of war is the perversion of minds it causes. Armies exist and the cost of war exists, and people must wrestle to find explanations for what exists. War cannot be explained with the intellect, so to justify it, people create intellectual perversions.",leo tolstoy,
"Do not try to justify war or the existence of the military. If you try to apply logical thought to explain things that are evil, the effort will only prevent your intellect and poison your heart.",leo tolstoy,
"The more lonely a person is, the more clearly he can hear the voice of God.",leo tolstoy,
"The will to accomplish your good intentions depends on whether you voice them. You remember the things of which you spoke in your youth as if they were flowers that you tore out of a flower bed and threw away, and then saw lying on the earth, faded into the dirt.",leo tolstoy,
"Temporary solitude from all things in this life, the meditation within yourself about the divine, is food as necessary for your soul as material food is for your body.",leo tolstoy,
"A sage is not afraid of lack of knowledge: he is not afraid of hesitations, or hard work, but he is afraid of only one thing—to pretend to know the things which he does not know.",leo tolstoy,
"Real wisdom comes, not from knowing what is good and what should be done, but from knowing which is the better thing and which is the worse, and therefore, what should be done and what should be done later.",leo tolstoy,
"To be wise one must study both good and bad thoughts and acts, but one should study the bad first. You should first know what isnotclever, what isnotjust, and what isnotnecessary to do.",leo tolstoy,
Religion is that which tells a person who he is and what the nature of the world in which he lives is.,leo tolstoy,
"We should teach our children those principles that are common to all religions—Buddhist, Muslim, Christian, Jewish, and so on, that is, for the moral science of love and the unification of all people.",leo tolstoy,
Most people do not listen to God but adore him. It is better not to adore but to listen.,leo tolstoy,
"Moral teaching is not complete if it is not religious, but religious teaching is useless if it is not based on morality, that is, if it does not lead to a good life.",leo tolstoy,
"Big wealth will not give you satisfaction. The more your wealth grows, the more your requirements grow with it.",leo tolstoy,
"There are two ways not to suffer from poverty. The first is to acquire more wealth. The second is to limit your requirements. The first is not always within our power, but the second is always in our power.",leo tolstoy,
Real love refers not just to love for a particular person but to the spiritual state of loving everyone.,leo tolstoy,
To love means to live within the lives of those whom you love.,leo tolstoy,
"Do not force others to love you; just love others, and you will be loved.",leo tolstoy,
"The more a person expresses his love, the more people love him; and the more people love him, the easier it is for him to love others. In this way, love is eternal.",leo tolstoy,
"Your spirit must constantly assert itself because your body is constantly exerting itself. As soon as you stop working at your spirit, then your body will have complete power over you.",leo tolstoy,
"A good thing is always done with an effort, and when the effort is repeated several times, then a good thing becomes a habit.",leo tolstoy,
"Do not detest any action which helps you to achieve good, or even more importantly—which can prevent you from doing evil.",leo tolstoy,
Illness should be viewed as a natural condition of life.,leo tolstoy,
"Neglecting your health can prevent you from serving people, and too much attention to your body and its health can bring the same results. In order to find the middle way, you should take care of your body only to the extent that doing so helps you to serve others, and does not stop you from serving them.",leo tolstoy,
"No illness can prevent a person from what he has to do. If you cannot work, then give your love to people.",leo tolstoy,
"Do not be afraid of illness, and do not think that being ill frees you from your moral requirements.",leo tolstoy,
"You can call God by various names, you can avoid his name altogether, but you cannot avoid accepting his existence. Nothing exists here if God does not exist.",leo tolstoy,
"All I know I know because there is God, and I know Him because He gives me the knowledge of everything.",leo tolstoy,
"It is very important to remember God, not necessarily with words, but in the sense of being aware of Him following your actions, supporting them or criticizing them. Russian peasants have a saying: “Do you remember God?”",leo tolstoy,
Only people who have never thought about life’s most important issues can believe that everything is possible for the human intellect.,leo tolstoy,
"There are three types of people. First, there are people who do not believe in anything; then, there are people who believe only in those teachings they were brought up to believe. Finally, there are people who believe in those things which they understand with their hearts, and this last group of people is the wisest and most resolute.",leo tolstoy,
Do not pretend to understand something that you do not. It is one of the worst possible things to do.,leo tolstoy,
"A person who comes into an understanding of the life of his spiritual self cannot fear evil, either in life or in death.",leo tolstoy,
Salvation in all things lies in their spirituality. Evil cannot touch a person who knows his spirituality.,leo tolstoy,
"A man is both an animal and a spiritual being at the same time. As an animal, a man is afraid of death; as a spiritual being he does not experience death.",leo tolstoy,
"In the last moments before death, the soul leaves the body. It unites with the limitless, timeless, and eternal soul and transforms into another form, we know not which. After death, our body is left behind, and it becomes only an object for observation.",leo tolstoy,
"Death marks a change, it marks the disappearance of the dwelling place of your conscience. The conscience itself cannot be destroyed by death, in the same way as the change of a theater set cannot destroy a spectator.",leo tolstoy,
Perhaps you fear the changes that death will bring?,leo tolstoy,
"But a similar great change already happened at the time of your birth, and nothing bad came out of it.",leo tolstoy,
"Most people are proud, not of those things which arouse respect, but of those which are unnecessary, or even harmful: fame, power, and wealth.",leo tolstoy,
"There is no worse scoundrel than he who, when he looks around himself at other people, can always find an even worse scoundrel than himself; and therefore, can be quite satisfied with himself.",leo tolstoy,
A person who loves himself has the advantage of having very few competitors.,leo tolstoy,
There is no wisdom in he who thinks that he is wise.,leo tolstoy,
A selfish person is always limited. And one is connected with the other: he is selfish because he is limited; he is limited because he is selfish.,leo tolstoy,
"A proud person initially causes other people to think that he has more importance than he actually has, but when this influence disappears, as it always does, he becomes only the object of jokes.",leo tolstoy,
"A society says to a man: “Think as we think, believe in what we believe, eat and drink what we eat and drink, and dress in the way we dress.”",leo tolstoy,
"It is bad to irritate people by stepping back from their customs and traditions, but it is even worse to deny the requirements of your conscience and intellect by following the customs of the crowd.",leo tolstoy,
"A state system, no matter what kind of state system it is, functions at a far remove from the requirements of Christianity.",leo tolstoy,
"State violence cannot be destroyed by decree, only by truth and love. Maybe state violence was necessary for previous generations; maybe it is even necessary now, but people should conceive of a kind of future government in which violence will not be necessary.",leo tolstoy,
You should live in such a way that violence is not necessary for you.,leo tolstoy,
"People are taught to speak, but their major concern should be how to keep silent.",leo tolstoy,
Keep silent. Give rest to your tongue more often than to your hands. You will never regret that you have kept silently but you will often regret that you spoke too much.,leo tolstoy,
"Your chief task in life is the care of your soul You should care for your soul and work to improve it, and you can improve it only with love.",leo tolstoy,
"The meaning of life lies in two major areas: your personal perfection and service to other people. You can serve while you are moving toward perfection, and you can move toward perfection by serving people.",leo tolstoy,
"When I talk of moving toward perfection, I mean moving from a material to a spiritual plane, a plane of goodness, without time or death.",leo tolstoy,
"Only one step lies between a five-year-old child and a man of my age. Between a newborn baby and a five-year-old child lies a huge distance. Between a fetus and a newborn baby lies an abyss; and between nonexistence and a fetus lies not only an abyss, but a gulf that surpasses comprehension.",leo tolstoy,
"From childhood to death, humans, no matter their lot in life, should strive to grow to get closer and closer to the spiritual life. Strive to learn what God wants, and your life will become filled with freedom and joy.",leo tolstoy,
"God is in all of us, and it is possible for all of us to find and understand him there.",leo tolstoy,
To know yourself is to discover the good that lies within.,leo tolstoy,
"If you are going through a hard time, work harder to understand God; as soon as you understand Him, all difficult things will become easy, and you will feel love and joy.",leo tolstoy,
"If a person does not feel a divine force within himself, this does not mean that a divine force does not exist in him, but that he has not yet learned how to recognize it.",leo tolstoy,
"If there are people and there is God, then there are relationships between God and people. These relationships are changing with time, and mankind’s religious conceptions are constantly evolving, constantly improving, becoming more clear and easily understood with the passage of time.",leo tolstoy,
"Religious conscience of mankind is not rigid, it is changing all the time, becoming purer and clearer.",leo tolstoy,
God is spirit and part of this spirit lives inside me and gives sense to my life.,leo tolstoy,
"There is much good to be learned from the Koran, from the Buddhists, from Confucius, from the Old Testament, from the Indian Upanishads, and from the New Testament. But the closer a religious thinker or philosopher is to us in time, the more he can help us draw from these teachings in the light of our present-day lives.",leo tolstoy,
The past no longer exists; the future has not yet come; there is only the present. And only in the present can the divine nature of the free human soul be manifested.,leo tolstoy,
"If you want to do a good deed, do it now. The time will pass, and you will not have the chance again.",leo tolstoy,
"The meaning of life is revealed to those who are ready to accept the things which will be revealed. And it is he who has already decided that he will accept the truth as it is, and not the truth itself, which will change the way of life he has been accustomed to.",leo tolstoy,
"Who am I? What should I do? What should I believe in and what should I hope for?All of philosophy is in these questions, said the philosopher Lichtenberg. But among all these questions, the most important one is that which is in the middle. If a person knows what he should do, he will understand everything which he should know.",leo tolstoy,
"The real meaning of life is not possible to embrace, if you are looking for the universal meaning of life. And at the same time it is so simple that it can be explained to fools and to infants when what to know is what you should do as an individual.",leo tolstoy,
"When you approach a man, you should think not about how he can help you, but how you might serve and help him.",leo tolstoy,
"We have the necessary law for all our actions, and this law cannot be restricted by any power. The fulfillment of this law is possible even in prison, and under the threat of tortures and death.",leo tolstoy,
"Look for a kind life which is in harmony with the will of God, and then you will fulfill the duty of your life.",leo tolstoy,
"In the same way as the storm troubles and muddies the waters, so too passions trouble our souls and interfere with our understanding of this life.",leo tolstoy,
"Real power is not in momentary desires, but in complete calmness.",leo tolstoy,
"Complete outer calmness is impossible. But when there are some calm periods, we should appreciate them and make them last longer. This is the time when useful thoughts appear; they become stronger and guide us in life.",leo tolstoy,
Make sure that you do not gossip about your brother.,leo tolstoy,
"Time passes, but the words which you say will remain.",leo tolstoy,
To stop your tongue from talking too much is a sign of great virtue.,leo tolstoy,
"If you think that it is necessary to judge your neighbor, then say this looking directly into his eyes, and say this in such a way that you do not create animosity.",leo tolstoy,
Conscience is the understanding of the divine beginning which lives in us.,leo tolstoy,
"You cannot fight with the requirements of conscience. These are the rules of God, and it is better to submit to them.",leo tolstoy,
"If the foundations of our life were not of the same nature in all of us, then we would not be able to explain to each other those feelings of compassion which we really experience.",leo tolstoy,
"There are many people who are more unhappy than you. This message cannot be a roof under which you may live, but it will be enough of a roof under which you may hide from storms.",leo tolstoy,
"Real compassion begins only when you put yourself in the place of those who suffer, and you feel real suffering.",leo tolstoy,
A person can understand his purpose in the same way as he understands his dignity. Only a religious person can understand his purpose in life.,leo tolstoy,
"The freedom of a person is a great thing, and even the freedom of a whole nation begins from the freedom of a single individual.",leo tolstoy,
"You should respect freedom in yourself, and in your neighbor, and in all people.",leo tolstoy,
Only he who understands himself as a spiritual being can understand the spiritual dignity of other people. Such a person will not lower himself with any act which is not worthy of a spiritual person.,leo tolstoy,
"For the moral, spiritual life, the importance of things is measured not by their material value, but by their level of goodness.",leo tolstoy,
"The majority of people want to do something unusual and difficult in order to improve their lives, but they would be better to purify their wishes, and improve their inner selves.",leo tolstoy,
"To move yourself from the material to the spiritual means to do only spiritual things. My material body pulls my inner self to itself, but I try to separate my spiritual self from the material body. Though I use my body, I live within my spiritual life, which is my real life.",leo tolstoy,
Real religion cannot be opposed to intellect.,leo tolstoy,
"In order to understand the truth, you should not suppress your intellect. On the contrary, you should purify your intellect, exercise it, and intellectually try and test everything which we can possibly put to the test.",leo tolstoy,
"Those things which we call happiness and those which we call unhappiness are useful for us, especially when we see them as opportunities to try ourselves.",leo tolstoy,
"The legend about the wandering Jew who was suffering the punishment of eternal life is very true. In the same way, there is a legend about a man who was punished by being given a life without any suffering.",leo tolstoy,
"There is nothing more important than an example. It leads us to do good deeds which would be impossible without this example. Therefore, if we use dissipated or passionate or cruel people as examples, it destroys our soul. The contrary is also true.",leo tolstoy,
"Those who do not think independently are under the influence of somebody else who thinks for them. If you give your thoughts to somebody else, it is a more shameful slavery than if you give your body to someone to possess.",leo tolstoy,
"If you desire to follow someone as an example, as many other people do, first stop and think whether it is worthwhile to follow this general example.",leo tolstoy,
Evil influence can be destroyed only by good influence. And the way to receive a good influence is to have a good life.,leo tolstoy,
A sense of self-importance so high that it surpasses all limits is a mental illness calledmania grandiosa.,leo tolstoy,
"People think that self-sacrifice violates your freedom. Those people do not know that sacrifice gives us complete freedom, and frees us from ourselves, from the slavery of our dissipation.",leo tolstoy,
"Our passions are the most terrible tyrants, and we can be the slave of them. Only self-sacrifice can free us from this slavery.",leo tolstoy,
"If you teach others how many insects exist in this world, or when you look at the spots on the sun, or when you write an opera or a novel—we do these things for different purposes. But to teach people goodness is done only for the purpose of self-sacrifice, service to others, and you cannot express this teaching without self-sacrifice. Christ gave his life on the cross for a great purpose, not in vain. And a sacrifice or suffering is never in vain, and it will triumph over everything.",leo tolstoy,
Nothing can interfere with the growth of truth in the world: nothing except the wish to save old prejudices.,leo tolstoy,
Humanity slowly but ceaselessly moves forward to the better and better understanding of the meaning of this life.,leo tolstoy,
Among the most terrible lies of all is to teach false faith to children.,leo tolstoy,
"Disrespect for traditions has not caused even one thousandth part of the great evil which was caused by the old prejudices, traditions, customs, and institutions which should not exist at present.",leo tolstoy,
"A man who considers himself the master of his own life can never be humble, because he thinks that he has no obligation to anyone. The man who considers service to God to be the purpose of his life is always humble, because he feels that he has never fulfilled his obligations.",leo tolstoy,
"A deed done only to achieve glory is always bad, no matter what consequences it has. A deed motivated equally by the desire to achieve goodness and to achieve glory is indifferent. A deed is truly good only when its motivation is to fulfill the law of God.",leo tolstoy,
"If you care too much about being praised, in the end you will not accomplish anything serious. People have different values. You may say, “I want good people to value me,” but you know you will respect only those who praise your actions.",leo tolstoy,
"Let the judgments of others he the consequence of your deeds, not their purpose.",leo tolstoy,
"To live only for God, you should do good works which no one will ever discover. Do so, and you will experience a special joy.",leo tolstoy,
"There is only one real law, the law of God, which is the same for all of mankind. Human law can be valid only when it is in harmony with the law of God.",leo tolstoy,
The first and most difficult obstruction to the fulfillment of the law of God is the fact that our society’s existing laws are completely opposed to this law.,leo tolstoy,
"In order to study the most important questions of life, everyone should destroy the prejudices and lies which were created by previous centuries in relation to all serious questions in life.",leo tolstoy,
"The law of God contradicts human law. So what should we do? Should we hide the law of God and proclaim human law? People have done this for almost nineteen centuries, and the contradiction becomes stronger and stronger. There is only one solution: to replace the existing laws with the law of God.",leo tolstoy,
"Debates conceal the truth more often than they reveal it. Real truth should be revealed in solitude. When it is revealed, it becomes clear to you that you can accept it without any argument or discussions.",leo tolstoy,
"He has power who can keep silent in an argument, even though he is right.",leo tolstoy,
"The more urgently you want to speak, the more likely it is that you will say something foolish.",leo tolstoy,
"Thought is the glorification of truth; therefore, bad thoughts are those which have not been thought through to the end.",leo tolstoy,
"You cannot send away a bad thought when it appears in your mind, but you can create other thoughts which will weaken or destroy this bad thought. For example, I may imagine that your friend or neighbor has some drawback, and I may not be able to banish this thought, but when I concentrate on the thought that criticizing another person is bad because I am not perfect, and he has the same God within him as I have within me, then I cannot stop loving this person.",leo tolstoy,
"Blaming your neighbor is harmful, both for you and for others.",leo tolstoy,
"Yesterday at a party, when a guest said good-bye and departed, everyone who was left started to slander him. The same thing happened to the second person when he left, and to all the guests, one after another, as they left. The last guest said, “Let me stay here and spend the night. I saw that all the people who left suffered and I am afraid for myself.”",leo tolstoy,
"I once met an old man who spoke very slowly, pausing for several seconds between his words. He did this because he was afraid to sin with his words.",leo tolstoy,
"Let us forgive each other. If we can forgive each other, then we can live in peace.",leo tolstoy,
"A word is an expression of thoughts; thoughts are the expression of divine force. Therefore, words should correspond to our true meaning. Speech can be indifferent, but it should not be an expression of evil.",leo tolstoy,
"You can look at life as death, and death as an awakening.",leo tolstoy,
"We ask the wrong question when we say, “What will happen after death?” When we speak about the future, we speak of time, but when we die, we leave time behind.",leo tolstoy,
"We come to a right understanding of our life in relation to God in the same way we understand our relation to the world and to its things. Without conscience, we would never know anything about God.",leo tolstoy,
"A good worker probably does not know the details of the life of his master. Only a lazy worker tries to do nothing except find out more about his master’s way of life, tastes, and preferences in order to please him. The same is true of a person’s attitude to God. It is important to accept Him as your master and to know what He wants you to do. I may never know the answers to the questions “What is He?” and “How does He live?” I will never find out because I am not equal to Him. I am His worker, not His master.",leo tolstoy,
"Every person understands God in different ways, but people fulfill His will in the same way.",leo tolstoy,
Self-admiration is the beginning of pride. Pride is dissipated self-admiration.,leo tolstoy,
"The most important thing in life is the path to perfection, and what kind of perfection can exist if a person is proud and satisfied with himself?",leo tolstoy,
"From the first moment the members of a religious gathering said, “The Holy Spirit is among us,” when they claimed theirs the highest authority above all other authorities, when they accepted the results of their own meditation as more worthy than the divine spark that exists in every person (that is, the intellect and the conscience), from this time, a great lie originated, a lie which deceives the bodies and souls of many people, which has destroyed millions of human beings, and which continues its terrible work.",leo tolstoy,
"If there is a true church, the people who are inside it cannot see it from the outside.",leo tolstoy,
"Moral perfection is the impossible goal, but moving to it is the law of human life.",leo tolstoy,
"Some people say, “Man is selfish, greedy, and dissipated, and cannot be kind to other people.” This is not true. We can be good. Feel in your heart the kind of person you should be; this feeling will give you power.",leo tolstoy,
"A woman accidentally dropped a precious pearl into the sea, and she started to scoop ocean water with a spade, one cup after another. A sea-sprite came to her and said, “When will you stop scooping up water?” The woman said, “When I have taken all the water from the sea, and retrieved my pearl from the bottom.” Then the sea-sprite retrieved the pearl and returned it to her.",leo tolstoy,
"Outer consequences are not in oar power to control; it is only possible to make an effort, and inner consequences always follow from our effort.",leo tolstoy,
"The land is the general and equal possession of all humanity, and therefore cannot be the property of individuals.",leo tolstoy,
The possession of land as property is one of the most unnatural crimes there is. We cannot see the horror of this crime because in our world it is accepted as law.,leo tolstoy,
"Self-perfection should be one’s primary motivation. If you are truthful to yourself, you will never be satisfied with yourself.",leo tolstoy,
Those who live life in perfection look only forward; those who have stopped moving forward look back on their achievements.,leo tolstoy,
Dissatisfaction is a necessary condition of intellectual life. It is only this dissatisfaction that pushes you to work.,leo tolstoy,
The most important knowledge is that which guides the way you lead your life.,leo tolstoy,
"It is harmful to eat if you are not hungry. It is even worse to have sex if you lack desire. But even more harmful is to try to think when you do not wish to, or to be engaged in meaningless intellectual activity. Many people do so when they want to improve their position.",leo tolstoy,
"What is important in knowledge is not quantity, but quality. It is important to know what knowledge is significant, what is less so, and what is trivial.",leo tolstoy,
The joy of wealth is inconstant.,leo tolstoy,
"For those who live a spiritual life, wealth is not only unnecessary but uncomfortable. It stops the development of one’s real life.",leo tolstoy,
"Faith answers those questions to which the intellect cannot find answers, but which must be asked.",leo tolstoy,
"We have only one sinless guide, a universal spirit which gets into all of us though we are all individuals, and which gives us the urge to do all that is necessary. The same spirit which exists in a tree and pushes it to grow straight and to produce seeds exists in us, urges us to be closer to God, and brings us closer to each other.",leo tolstoy,
"When a person is alive, he believes; the closer his faith is to the truth, the happier his life. The further from the truth his faith is, the more unhappy he is.",leo tolstoy,
Without faith he does not live; he dies a premature death or else kills himself.,leo tolstoy,
"We suffer from the past, and we spoil our future because we neglect the present.",leo tolstoy,
The best the future can offer is dreams. There is only one thing which really exists: the present.,leo tolstoy,
"There is no past and no future; no one has ever entered those two imaginary kingdoms. There is only the present. Do not worry about the future, because there is no future. Live in the present and for the present, and if your present is good, then it is good forever.",leo tolstoy,
"If you have difficult times, if you suffer from the loss of loved ones or from fears about the future, remember that life exists only in the present and direct all your thoughts and memories to this present. All your anguish about the past and your worries about the future will disappear, and you will feel freedom and happiness.",leo tolstoy,
"You cannot measure good by either the feeling of need or sacrifice, but only by the communication with God which is established between the giver and the receiver.",leo tolstoy,
"All people become closer, more or less, to one of two opposite limits: one is life only for oneself, and the other is life only for God.",leo tolstoy,
"We do good only when we do not notice what we do, when we forget ourselves and live only in others.",leo tolstoy,
"A material evil done by a person does not return to the evildoer, but the evil feeling which was created by the sinful deed will fester in his soul and sooner or later make him suffer.",leo tolstoy,
There is no material goodness which can restore the soul after the damage done by the evil which you create.,leo tolstoy,
Remember: Those who suffer through to the end will be saved. Very often a person becomes desperate or even stops in his purpose when only a small effort is needed to achieve it.,leo tolstoy,
Persecution and suffering are the necessary conditions of the fulfillment of Christian law. Persecution is precious because it reveals whether a person lives with real faith.,leo tolstoy,
"Do not seek love in other people, and do not complain about the absence of their love for you. Some people love wrong, not right; therefore, try to please God, rather than people.",leo tolstoy,
There is no deed in this life so impossible that you cannot do it. Your whole life should be lived as an heroic deed.,leo tolstoy,

"All things, even the most complicated things, become simple and clear if you separate them from other people and place them before God for judgment.",leo tolstoy,
"Other than our service to God, all our actions, whether we consider them important or not, are completely trivial. We may not know what the consequences of our actions will be, but we know what we should do.",leo tolstoy,
"The more busy you are with the improvement of your inner life, the more active you become in social life, helping other people.",leo tolstoy,
"Never build, but always plant: in the case of the first, nature will interfere and destroy the creation of your work, but in the case of the second, nature will help you, causing growth in everything you planted. The same thing happens in your spiritual life: those things which are in harmony with the eternal laws of human nature will grow, but those things which correspond to the temporal wishes of people will not.",leo tolstoy,
"The question of life’s meaning is a difficult problem which cannot be solved. So, too, is the question, “Why did God send us into this world?” But the meaning of life becomes very simple when a person asks himself, “What should I do?”",leo tolstoy,
"Your life may be cut short at any time; therefore, your life should have a deep purpose, a significance that will not depend on whether it is short or long.",leo tolstoy,
"There is only one way, if you want to live without understanding the meaning of your life: to become addicted to tobacco, alcohol, and drugs, and to live in the world of permanent entertainment.",leo tolstoy,
"This world is not a joke but rather a place for a trial, a way station to a better, eternal world. Our purpose is to make it a better and more joyous place to live, for those who live with us and those who come after us.",leo tolstoy,
"Our soul’s perfection is our life’s purpose; any other purpose, keeping death in mind, has no substance.",leo tolstoy,
"Helping others takes the form not only of physical aid, but of spiritual support for your neighbor. Stop blaming your neighbor and respect his human dignity.",leo tolstoy,

"War is murder. No matter how many people get together to commit murder or what they call themselves, murder is the worst sin in the world.",leo tolstoy,
"The majority of people now understand not only the uselessness, but also the stupidity and cruelty of any war.",leo tolstoy,
"Until such time as people reject the power of government to govern, to tax, to legislate, and to punish, war will never stop. War is the consequence of the government’s power.",leo tolstoy,
"Just as one candle lights another and can light thousands of other candles, so one heart illuminates another heart and can illuminate thousands of other hearts.",leo tolstoy,
"Good books are a good influence. Good art is a good influence. Prayer is an influence as well. But the strongest influence is the example of a good life. A good life becomes a blessing for people, not only for those who live good lives but those who can see, know, and understand such lives.",leo tolstoy,
Beware of groups of people who are harmful for your soul. Try to avoid them. You should praise good company and seek it.,leo tolstoy,
"If a passion embraces you, you should remember that this passionate desire is not a part of your soul, but a dark covering which shuts out the true qualities of your soul.",leo tolstoy,
"As soon as you feel passion, try to feel in yourself the understanding of your divine nature. As soon as you perceive that your divine nature is inactive and that you are possessed by passions, fight with these passions.",leo tolstoy,
"Life is not destroyed, only changed, by death.",leo tolstoy,
"Faith in the eternity is given to us not in meditation, but in life.",leo tolstoy,
"It is not reasoning which will convince you of the necessity of life after death, but example: when you walk very close to a person, hand in hand, and this person disappears into an abyss,over there, stop in front of the abyss and try to look within it.",leo tolstoy,
The level of fear you feel about death is the level of your understanding of life.,leo tolstoy,
"The less you fear death, the more you possess freedom, tranquillity, and an understanding of the greatness of your spirit and the joy of life.",leo tolstoy,
The understanding of eternity is part of the nature of the human soul.,leo tolstoy,
A word is an action.,leo tolstoy,
"Your enemies can be more useful to you than your friends, because your friends can often pardon your weaknesses, but your enemies notice them and attract your attention to them.",leo tolstoy,
Do not neglect the opinion of your enemies.,leo tolstoy,
Never is there a single instance when a lie can be justified.,leo tolstoy,
"When a humble person forgets himself, he is united with God.",leo tolstoy,
"The more humble a person is, the freer and stronger be is.",leo tolstoy,
"A woman does not differ from a man in her chief mission. This mission is to serve God. The difference is in the method of this service. Though the mission of a woman’s life is the same as that of a man’s life and the service to God is fulfilled by the same means, namely love, for the majority of women the method of this service is more specific than for men. This is the birth and upbringing of new workers for the Lord throughout life.",leo tolstoy,
"It is not usually husbands who choose their wives, but wives who choose their husbands. In order to find a better father for her children, a woman must know good and evil. Therefore, women should have a good education first of all.",leo tolstoy,
There is nothing more natural for a woman than self-sacrifice. Nothing can be more unpleasant in her than selfishness.,leo tolstoy,
"“Do not kill”: these word refer not just to the killing of a person, but to the killing of anything which is alive. This commandment was written in the people’s hearts even before it was heard on Mt. Sinai.",leo tolstoy,
"Whatever arguments they use against vegetarianism, men cannot prevent themselves from feeling compassion and disgust at killing sheep, cows, or chickens. Most people would rather stop eating meat than kill these animals themselves.",leo tolstoy,
"The more people become educated and the more our population grows, the more people will move from eating animals to eating plants.",leo tolstoy,
"The stupidity, lawlessness, and harm, both physical and moral, of meat eating is so clear that meat eating is not supported by reasoning but by old traditions and prejudices. We should not even argue about the absence of logic in eating meat; it is self-evident.",leo tolstoy,
Art is the activity whereby a person makes a conscious attempt to use the particular means at his disposal to transmit his feelings to others so that they feel them as intensely as he does.,leo tolstoy,
"In a true creation of art, there is not only no border between the work of art and the artist, but also between the work and the other people who experience it. The major attraction of real art lies in this unification.",leo tolstoy,
A new work of art should bring a new emotion in our life.,leo tolstoy,
Emerson said that music helps people to find the greatness in their souls. The same can be said about any form of art.,leo tolstoy,
"Contemporary artists and scholars do not fulfill and cannot fulfill their destinies, because they have transformed their duties into their rights.",leo tolstoy,
"It is not said by chance that the essence of divine law is to love God and your neighbor. Neighbors come and go, but God exists always. Therefore, a man can fulfill this law when he is alone in a desert, or when he is in prison. He can love God and God’s manifestations even in his thoughts, memories, and imagination.",leo tolstoy,
"Remember that the spirit of God exists in every person, the same spirit that gives you life. Therefore you should not only love but respect the soul of every person as a holy place.",leo tolstoy,
"Do not do anything, either among others or alone, which is opposed by your conscience.",leo tolstoy,
"Beyond his duty to his neighbor, every person has an obligation to himself, as to the Son of God.",leo tolstoy,
"The longer mankind exists, the more liberated it becomes from prejudice and the more clearly it perceives the law of life.",leo tolstoy,
Do not be afraid of the way your intellect calls into question old stories and legends. The pure intellect cannot destroy anything without replacing it with the truth: this is one of its essential qualities.,leo tolstoy,
We have misconceptions not because we think illogically but because we live our lives badly.,leo tolstoy,
"The fight between the spiritual and material inner nature goes on in everyone. Thus, all people have misconceptions, and many will always mistake them for the truth.",leo tolstoy,
"To feed the hungry, to clothe the naked, to visit the ill in the hospital—these are acts of mercy, but there is one charitable deed which cannot be compared to them: to free your brother from misconception.",leo tolstoy,
"Life consists of numerous invisible, imperceptible changes, changes that began at birth and end with death. It is not possible for us humans to observe them all.",leo tolstoy,
Death is a change to a form with which our spirit is united. You should not confuse the form with those things with which it is united.,leo tolstoy,
"It seems so easy to fulfill the law of God that is expressed in the Christian teaching, but we are still so far from this fulfillment!",leo tolstoy,
"Man’s purpose is to serve all mankind, not to serve only one man while doing harm to others.",leo tolstoy,
"For a Christian, the love of one’s motherland can be an obstacle to the love of one’s neighbor.",leo tolstoy,
Patriotism is not a virtue. Sacrificing your life for an institution which embodies prejudice cannot be your duty.,leo tolstoy,
"People do many bad things for selfish reasons; they do worse things for their families. But they do the worst in the name of patriotism, and they are made proud by these crimes: spying, unduly heavy tax collecting, sacrificing lives, and waging wars.",leo tolstoy,
Loving your country and loving your family are both virtues that can become vices when they become overwhelming and damage your love for your neighbor.,leo tolstoy,
"One of the worst things possible is to follow the rule: “Be like everyone, follow the crowd.”",leo tolstoy,
"There is no evil in the world itself. All evil exists in our souls, and can be destroyed.",leo tolstoy,
Nothing is more joyful than the labor of a farmer tilling the soil.,leo tolstoy,
"Working on the land and making your own bread isn’t necessary for all people, but no type of work is more important for humanity, and no type of work offers a greater degree of independence and good.",leo tolstoy,
Kindness defeats everything and can never be defeated.,leo tolstoy,
"If a good action has an ulterior cause, then it is not truly good. If it expects reward, it is not truly good. Good things are beyond reason and consequence.",leo tolstoy,
"We do good to people not in hope of reward, but because we see the divine spirit within everyone.",leo tolstoy,
"The best and easiest way to thwart evil in this world is to respond to it with kind words, return an evil action with good.",leo tolstoy,
True faith is faith only if the actions of your life are in harmony with it and never contradict it.,leo tolstoy,
"We can never fully understand the final purpose of human life. A construction worker who works at a construction site can have no idea of the final form or general design of the large structure he builds, but he can know that he is working on something good, something beautiful, clever, and necessary, both for him and for the world. This is faith.",leo tolstoy,
"Do not believe in words, yours or others’; believe in the deeds.",leo tolstoy,
"Those who can raise their thoughts to heaven will always have clear days, because the sun always shines above the clouds.",leo tolstoy,
"If you are gnawed by desire or fear you must not believe in God, who is filled with love, and who exists in you. If you believe in Him, you know that you need not wish for anything because the wishes of God always come true; and you need never be afraid of anything, because God fears nothing.",leo tolstoy,
"Whatever may happen to you, you will never be unhappy if you understand your unification with God.",leo tolstoy,
Only misconceptions need to be supported by elaborate arguments. Truth can always stand alone.,leo tolstoy,
"A person cannot be completely truthful all the time, because different forces and aspirations fight within him, and sometimes he cannot express them, even to himself.",leo tolstoy,
"Misconceptions exist only for a finite period of time, but real truth remains as it always was, after all tricks, sophisms, and lies have withered away.",leo tolstoy,
"Learn what to do, think, and say the truth at all times. Only when you start to learn this can you understand how far we are from real truth.",leo tolstoy,
Lies are always harmful to all living things.,leo tolstoy,
No person is without sin; no person is completely truthful. It is not that one person is virtuous and truthful and another is sinful and deceitful; rather it’s that one person strives to move toward truth and virtue and the other does not.,leo tolstoy,
Only the spread of love between people can improve the existing social structure.,leo tolstoy,
Love gives meaning to human life. This we have known since antiquity. But what is love? Many wise people throughout the ages have tried to solve this question.,leo tolstoy,
"Only one clear quality marks an action as either good or evil: If it increases the amount of love in the world, it is good. If it separates people and creates animosity among them, it is bad.",leo tolstoy,
"The time is coming, a time of concord, harmony, forgiveness, and love. Depend on it. We must do everything in our power to bring this time closer, and to stop those things which delay its arrival.",leo tolstoy,
"Our understanding of ourselves as discrete beings separate from each other grows out of conditions of our life in time and space. The less we feel this separation, the more we feel our unification with all other living creatures, the lighter our load, and the more joyful our life will be.",leo tolstoy,
"We manifest in love our understanding of the unity of our being with others, and in so doing we make our life greater. The more we love, the wider, larger, and more joyful our life becomes.",leo tolstoy,
"Mankind moves ceaselessly toward perfection, not of every person’s accord, but through the efforts that some particular individuals make toward their personal perfection. The kingdom of God will be created by these individual efforts.",leo tolstoy,
"We hear often that there is no use in working to improve our life, to fight evil, or to establish justice, because progress will occur by itself. Imagine that a boat floats along a river. Imagine that those who have sat by the oars and rowed tirelessly have stopped and gone ashore; and that the travelers who remain in the boat do not bother to take up the oars and push the boat further, but think that it will travel by itself, as before, into the future.",leo tolstoy,
"Every person should make a small effort, even the smallest effort, to improve the general well-being of humanity.",leo tolstoy,
Real goodness is in your hands. It follows a good person as a shadow follows its object.,leo tolstoy,
"The greater the effort a person makes to achieve pleasure, the less possible it is for him to possess real goodness, or love.",leo tolstoy,
They who say that doing good causes them unhappiness either don’t believe in God or aren’t doing something that is truly good.,leo tolstoy,
"The real purpose of Christianity is obvious to all, and it is stronger than the lies which try to pervert it.",leo tolstoy,
"I see a new religion based on mutual trust, which appeals to our deepest selves, and which teaches that a person should love goodness without reward, and that the divine exists in everyone.",leo tolstoy,
"Do not think that you will personally see the coming of the kingdom of God. But have no doubt that it will come soon: it is coming closer and closer, without hesitation.",leo tolstoy,
"At the highest level of consciousness, an individual is alone. Such solitude can seem strange, unusual, even difficult. Foolish people try to escape it by means of various dissipations in order to get away from this high point, to some point lower, but wise people remain at this high point, with the help of prayer.",leo tolstoy,
"God wants us to fulfill his will here on earth, in our lives. But life’s interests and passions distract us from this every minute. When we understand this, we can gird ourselves with the physical expression of our attitude to God, prayer.",leo tolstoy,
"A personality is a limitation and, therefore, God, as we understand Him, is not a personality. Prayer is our address to God and yet how can we address one who has no personality? I address God as if He were a person, though I know it is not so.",leo tolstoy,
"A person buried in a deep mine, freezing from the cold in deep ice, dying from hunger alone on the open sea, wasting away in solitude in a prison cell, or simply dying at home, deaf and blind—how could this person live out the remainder of his life if prayer did not exist?",leo tolstoy,
"One can live without prayer either when he is possessed by his passions or when his life is completely dedicated to God. But for a person who is fighting his passion and yet far from fulfilling his duty, prayer is a necessary condition of life.",leo tolstoy,
"Nothing seems to check the notion that the way to improve civilization is affected by changing its outer forms. This notion is false, and draws the activity of too many people away from effort that truly can improve our lives.",leo tolstoy,
"When we accept false and violent laws and submit to them, we can neither establish truth nor combat lies in this world.",leo tolstoy,
Wisdom is understanding how eternal truth can be applied to life.,leo tolstoy,
"Socrates was the first who brought philosophy from heaven, distributed it among the people, and enticed them to study the science of life, human morals, and the consequences of good and evil.",leo tolstoy,
"Science is seldom connected with wisdom. A scholarly person knows many unnecessary things. A wise person knows few things, but all that he knows is necessary both for humanity and for himself.",leo tolstoy,
"The goodness given to us by wisdom compares to all other knowledge in the same way that in a desert, a vessel filled with water compares to mountains of gold.",leo tolstoy,
"Starting from early childhood, as we age we feel the growth of our spiritual power and the diminution of our physical power.",leo tolstoy,
"The growth of our physical energy prepares us for spiritual work, for serving God and mankind; this work starts when our body begins to fade away.",leo tolstoy,
Grow spiritually and help others to do so; it is the meaning of life.,leo tolstoy,
"Terrible is the situation of those who cannot perceive spiritual growth in themselves. They can see only physical life, which will disappear in time.",leo tolstoy,
"When you understand your spiritual being and live with it, then instead of despairing you understand the joy that can never be destroyed, which always grows.",leo tolstoy,
"Kindness and virtue come from the heart, and should be performed without thought for the opinion of others, or of future rewards.",leo tolstoy,
"Virtue and charity start at home. If you have to go somewhere to display it, then it is not virtue.",leo tolstoy,
"Assistance given to the poor by the rich is too often just a gesture of politeness, not real charity.",leo tolstoy,
"Charity is good only when it comes as a sacrifice; only then do those who receive the material gift receive the spiritual gift too. If it is not a sacrifice but a discharge of excess, it can only irritate those who receive it.",leo tolstoy,
"Childhood is the period in which underlying convictions are formed. Therefore, the most important part of education is the selection of the things of which a child should be convinced.",leo tolstoy,
Talking and reasoning does not even have one thousandth the influence a true example has. All lessons about how to behave are worthless when children see the opposite in real life.,leo tolstoy,
"It is important to teach children kindness and simplicity in life and work. All of children’s moral and spiritual education should be supported by your own good example. You should live virtuously, or at least try to do so; the success of your good life will educate your children.",leo tolstoy,
"All that we see and know does not exist in reality, because it is the product of our limited ability to understand reality.",leo tolstoy,
"Old fortresses are destroyed, monuments to kings are demolished, old age ravages our bodies. Only the teachings of kindness are never ruined or affected by age.",leo tolstoy,
"As soon as a person truly looks at himself as only a physical body, then he sees an unsolved puzzle, a contradiction that cannot be unraveled.",leo tolstoy,
In order to understand the true essence of a thing we must transform the physical into the spiritual.,leo tolstoy,
Science is vitally important when it is harnessed to reveal the law of human life.,leo tolstoy,
"In order to accept the importance of science, we must prove that this activity is useful. Scientists usually demonstrate that they are doing something and that maybe sometime, someday, this could be useful for people in the future.",leo tolstoy,
"“Science” is not quite the concept which people use this word to identify; it is the highest, most important, most necessary object of our understanding.",leo tolstoy,
"The wild instinct of military murder has developed in humanity over the course of thousands of years, and has become rooted in our brains. We must hope that our society will be able to rid itself of this terrible crime.",leo tolstoy,
Wars can be stopped only if people are ready to be persecuted for not participating in them. This is the only way.,leo tolstoy,
The understanding of the fraternity and equality of all people becomes more and more popular among mankind.,leo tolstoy,
Family and motherland are but two circles that are part of the wider circle that is humanity. Those who teach morality and who limit one’s duties only to family and country teach a selfishness which is dangerous for all of us.,leo tolstoy,
"The understanding of one’s unity with all of humanity comes from the understanding of the divine beginning in us all, and gives all our greatest good. True religion creates this understanding, and different prejudices interfere with it—prejudice of state, nation, and class.",leo tolstoy,
"The past does not exist. The future has not begun. The present is an infinitely small point in time in which the already nonexistent past meets the imminent future. At this point, which is timeless, a person’s real life exists.",leo tolstoy,
"Time is behind us, time is before us, but in the present there is no time.",leo tolstoy,
"Time does not exist. There is only a small and infinite present, and it is only in this present that our life occurs. Therefore, a person should concentrate all his spiritual force only on this present.",leo tolstoy,
